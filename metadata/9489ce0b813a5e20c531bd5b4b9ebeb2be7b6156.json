Think about it\nlike this: around 25 of the program code is MCFACT protected\nand therefore protection-related. As you can imagine the\neffort to analyze and reverse such a target is incredibly\nhigh. This time it took us almost 4000 man hours to emulate\nthe little beast!\n\nQ: Will it work with the 64bit version? Are there plans to make\na release of the 64bit version?\nA: No and No! Nevertheless it will perfectly work as a 32bit\napplication on a 64bit OS like Windows7.\n\nQ: Who the f**k is Gouda?\nA: One of the two heads behind all the previous syncrosoft\nemulations.\nThis is my kind of get well soon greetings to you brother!\nIf you really have to leave this world that young it would\ndefinitely be the end of an era!\nIt has always been a pleasure to work with you (well DELPHI\nstill suxx) and I really wish we could have done this project\ntogether too!\n\nQ: What do you you think about peace-out?\nA: Bunch of wannabe crackerz. None of their current releases\nwork properly. They dont even understand the basics of the\nprotection. Were happy to see other groups giving it a go\nif those other groups can produce quality. We dont see that\nwith peace-out, really they should leave the big boys pool\nand go play with the toddlers.\n\nQ: What do you think of open forums who spread AiRs internal\nwork without respect and before the time?\nA: f**k you!\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nSeed after downlod / comment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9489ce0b813a5e20c531bd5b4b9ebeb2be7b6156","amp;dn":"Steinberg.Cubase.v5.1.DVDR-AiRISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9489ce0b813a5e20c531bd5b4b9ebeb2be7b6156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,137,206,11,129,58,94,32,197,49,189,91,75,158,190,178,190,123,97,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
