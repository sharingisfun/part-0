Muddy Waters is generally considered one of the most influential bluesmen of all time. His fondness for playing in mud earned him the nickname Ã¢â‚¬Å“MuddyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at an early age. He later changed it to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Muddy WaterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and finally Ã¢â‚¬Å“Muddy WatersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adcbdb0438ffe47089f83a76d9f410ee1f516462","amp;dn":"Muddy+Waters+-+Anthology+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adcbdb0438ffe47089f83a76d9f410ee1f516462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,203,219,4,56,255,228,112,137,248,58,118,217,244,16,238,31,81,100,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
