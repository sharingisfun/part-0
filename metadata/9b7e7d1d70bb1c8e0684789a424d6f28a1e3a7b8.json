  "description": "PC Game\nDVD ISO\nCrack by HATRED.\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry returns for his fifth year of study at Hogwarts and discovers that much of the wizarding community has been denied the truth about the teenagerÃƒÂ¢??s recent encounter with the evil Lord Voldemort. Fearing that HogwartsÃƒÂ¢?? venerable Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, is lying about VoldemortÃƒÂ¢??s return in order to undermine his power and take his job, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, appoints a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher to keep watch over Dumbledore and the Hogwarts students. But Professor Dolores UmbridgeÃƒÂ¢??s Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves DumbledoreÃƒÂ¢??s Army, Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.\n\nRequirements:\nOptical Drive: DVD-ROM\nCPU Speed: 933MHz\nDisk Space: 5.0GB\nDisplay: AGP Video Card With 64 MB+ and NVIDIA GeForce 3+ or ATI Radeon 8500+ Memory (RAM): 256MB\nOperating System Compatibility: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/VISTA, Mac OS X\n\nTested and working on XP.\nHATRED have a patch included to make it run on Windows 2000.\n",
