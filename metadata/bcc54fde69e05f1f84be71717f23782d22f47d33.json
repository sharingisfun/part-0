Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's &quot;I Disappear&quot;. Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just &quot;sharing&quot; by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was &quot;borrowing things that were not yours without asking&quot;. He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, &quot;I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own.&quot; Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.\r\n\r\nOn August 18, 2016, the band announced via their website that their tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, would be released worldwide on November 18, 2016 via their independent label, Blackened Recordings.
