  "description": "\nAerosmith - Greatest Hits (Mp3@320Kbps)\n\nIncludes: ID3 Tags Album Art &amp; Covers\n\nTrackList:\n\n01. Dream On\n02. Same Old Song And Dance\n03. Sweet Emotion\n04. Walk This Way\n05. Last Child\n06. Back In The Saddle\n07. Draw The Line\n08. Kings And Queens\n09. Come Together\n10. Remember (Walking In The Sand)\n\nInfo:\nGreatest Hits is the first greatest hits compilation album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released by Columbia Records in October 1980.\nIt went multi-platinum and contained the songs that made the band an icon of the 1970s rock era.\n\nSome of the tracks were significantly edited from their original versions. \nThe single version of &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot; was used, and was edited down almost a full minute. \nIt also contained an alternate lyric which wasn't heard on Get Your Wings. \nThe original lyric was &quot;Gotcha with the cocaine, found with your gun.&quot; \nThe alternate lyric, included on the compilation, was &quot;You shady lookin' loser, you played with my gun.&quot; &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; also used the considerably less popular single version. \nThe coda which ends the song was replaced with a repeating of the chorus and fades out. \nThe song also begins with the first chorus, cutting out the now famous talk box intro. &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; was also edited down, cutting the intro and certain other parts. &quot;Walk This Way&quot; was edited slightly, chanting the first chorus once instead of twice. \nThe other remaining tracks were kept intact.\n\nReview:\n\nEven before their second fling with the pop mainstream, Aerosmith were one of Top 40's favorite hard-rock bands, so ubiquitous--and so funky--that Run-D.M.C. were vociferous fans. Their '70s output included at least three classic albums (Aerosmith, Toys in the Attic, and Rocks). This disc collects unstoppable singles into a horny, howling little piece of archaeology that makes even weak links like &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; sound great. And the truly great stuff here--&quot;Sweet Emotion,&quot; &quot;Last Child,&quot; &quot;Dream On&quot;--runs the gamut of style and feeling from swaggering freak-flag-flying to power-ballad roots that display a genuine ache. \nYour Aerosmith collection shouldn't end here, but this red-and-white bomb is a great place to start. --Rickey Wright\n\n\n\nMultiTracker @ FrankFoo\n\n",
