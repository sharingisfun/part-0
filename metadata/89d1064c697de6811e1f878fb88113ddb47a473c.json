Lyla is a renowned and beautiful cellist and Louis is a guitar player and vocalist at a club. Lyla and Louis fall in love once they meet each other following the music. Since they have different lives, they have to separate without seeing each other again. However, Lyla has had their baby - Evan, a prodigy born to music. Lyla has an accident and bears the baby but Lyla&amp;#x27;s father gives the baby to an orphanage without telling her, for fear of affecting her career. After that, both Louis and Lyla give up their music careers. Eleven years later, poor little Evan believes that his parents are waiting for him and goes to New York to find them. In New York, his musical gift leads him to success but also gives him some trouble. A monger uses Evan to make money and prevents him from achieving success. He escapes and runs into a church and people there are surprised by his gift and send him to the best music school...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.piczend.com/images/mu0R93l8/7wib2envm5u1kbhy2qs7gh4s1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.piczend.com/images/mu0R93l8/7wib2envm5u1kbhy2qs7gh4s1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.piczend.com/images/mu0R93l8/va0pmymzxerbsnnn7en8cb1tt.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.piczend.com/images/mu0R93l8/va0pmymzxerbsnnn7en8cb1tt.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.piczend.com/images/mu0R93l8/ypqt8iez9jbywal1rnjurmsvz.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.piczend.com/images/mu0R93l8/ypqt8iez9jbywal1rnjurmsvz.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89d1064c697de6811e1f878fb88113ddb47a473c","amp;dn":"August+Rush+%282007%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89d1064c697de6811e1f878fb88113ddb47a473c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,209,6,76,105,125,230,129,30,31,135,143,184,129,19,221,180,122,71,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
