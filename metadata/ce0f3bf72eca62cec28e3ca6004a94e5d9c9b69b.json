Ã¢â‚¬Å“Art-HoundsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWorld Peace Is None of Your Business is the tenth solo studio album by Morrissey, produced by Joe Chiccarelli (the White Stripes, Beck, the Strokes) and recorded in France with his touring band, Boz Boorer (guitar), Jesse Tobias (guitar), Solomon Walker (bass), Matthew Walker (drums), and Gustavo Manzur (keyboards).\nEach single for the LP has been accompanied by a spoken-word iteration of its self, allowing the Morrissey-nesque of songs titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Bullfighter DiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Earth Is the Loneliest PlanetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to shine minus any pesky hints of pop-song (though with, in the case of the latter, the appearance of Pamela Anderson).\nThis tack may be appreciated by those whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve winced at the sound of MorrisseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœcomebackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nera, which began, in earnest, with 2004's You Are The Quarry. This run of records has persisted, largely, with a modern-rock-radio sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proved not-entirely-sympathetic to the doomed romanticism of the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature baritone. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sound that persists, in part, on World Peace Is None of Your Business, most horrifyingly on the awful Ã¢â‚¬Å“Neal Cassady Drops Dead,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which a man oft regarded as one of rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most idiosyncratic lyricists rhymes Ã¢â‚¬Å“babiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Ã¢â‚¬Å“rabies,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ summoning horrifying memories of SilverchairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Freak.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBut thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gladly, more of a sense of doomed romanticism in the music, too. And, a sense of Ã¢â‚¬ËœclassicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Moz at play in a run of three blessed tunes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Staircase At the UniversityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ filled with baleful jangle thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll warm the heart of Smiths fans; Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Bullfighter DiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ employing Spanish motifs (a recurring musical theme on the LP) with wit; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kiss Me a LotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most immediate pop-song.\n\nThe true spirit of World Peace Is None of Your Business isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found, though, in its more strummy and summery moments. Instead, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album best understood by studying its excesses, the idiosyncratic epics that mirror its maker. The eight-minute epic Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not a ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitive track; its Southpaw Grammar-esque prog building a grandiose shrine to the glories of Morrissey. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never kill or eat an animal,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Morrissey sings, as if still in memoir-penning mode, listing off his Ã¢â‚¬ËœnegativeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ traits (Ã¢â‚¬Å“wise-ass, smart-ass, workaholic, thick-skinnedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) as proud positives. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a song self-obsessed and utterly shameless, which at least makes World Peace feel, if only for a moment, like definitive Moz.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]",
