In their second year of studies, Joe showed Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on Garageband. \n\nGus completed the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lineup and together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ first as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as FILMSÃ¢â‚¬â€œ the four friends spent the next two years playing around town, developing a precise and unique brand of alt. pop that draws on poignant folk verses, crushing synths, smart hip hop syncopations and tight vocal harmonies. A small set was quickly developed using these and newly-written songs, and the band began to build a modest reputation through some crammed gigs in their front room. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://altjband.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://altjband.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bbb22e5bcb119069a628adfcb8af1af1900f46e","amp;dn":"alt-J+%28%E2%88%86%29+-+An+Awesome+Wave+%5B2012%5D+%5BAlbum%5D+%28V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bbb22e5bcb119069a628adfcb8af1af1900f46e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,187,34,229,188,177,25,6,154,98,138,223,203,138,241,175,25,0,244,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
