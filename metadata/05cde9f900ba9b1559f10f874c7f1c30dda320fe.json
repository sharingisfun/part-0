This book also discusses the issue of dissimilar joint between metal and ceramic, as well as the technology of diffusion bonding. \r\n\r\nContents:\r\n\r\nPreface:\r\n\r\n1. Introductory Chapter: A Brief Introduction to Joining and Welding \r\n2. New Approaches to the Friction Stir Welding of Aluminum Alloys \r\n3. A Mesh-Free Solid-Mechanics Approach for Simulating the Friction Stir-Welding Process \r\n4. Gas Tungsten Arc Welding with Synchronized Magnetic Oscillation \r\n5. A Comprehensive Model of the Transport Phenomena in Gas Metal Arc Welding \r\n6. The Analysis of Temporary Temperature Field and Phase Transformations in One-Side Butt-Welded Steel Flats \r\n7. Laser and Hybrid Laser-Arc Welding \r\n8. Current Issues and Problems in the Joining of Ceramic to Metal \r\n9. Diffusion Bonding: Influence of Process Parameters and Material Microstructure \r\n10.
