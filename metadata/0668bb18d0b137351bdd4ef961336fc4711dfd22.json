Louisa Clark is an ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary lifeâ€”steady boyfriend, close familyâ€”who has never been farther afield than their tiny village. She takes a badly needed job working for exâ€“Master of the Universe Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge lifeâ€”big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travelâ€”and now heâ€™s pretty sure he cannot live the way he is. Will is acerbic, moody, bossyâ€”but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living. A Love Story for this generation, Me Before You brings to life two people who couldnâ€™t have less in commonâ€”a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?\r\n\r\n#2 - After You: Louisa Clark is no longer just an ordinary girl living an ordinary life. After the transformative six months spent with Will Traynor, she is struggling without him. When an extraordinary accident forces Lou to return home to her family, she canâ€™t help but feel sheâ€™s right back where she started. Her body heals, but Lou herself knows that she needs to be kick-started back to life. Which is how she ends up in a church basement with the members of the Moving On support group, who share insights, laughter, frustrations, and terrible cookies. They will also lead her to the strong, capable Sam Fieldingâ€”the paramedic, whose business is life and death, and the one man who might be able to understand her. Then a figure from Willâ€™s past appears and hijacks all her plans, propelling her into a very different future. . . . For Lou Clark, life after Will Traynor means learning to fall in love again, with all the risks that brings. But here Jojo Moyes gives us two families, as real as our own, whose joys and sorrows will touch you deeply, and where both changes and surprises await","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0668bb18d0b137351bdd4ef961336fc4711dfd22","amp;dn":"Me+Before+You+series+by+Jojo+Moyes+%281-2%29+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0668bb18d0b137351bdd4ef961336fc4711dfd22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,104,187,24,208,177,55,53,27,221,78,249,97,51,111,196,113,29,253,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
