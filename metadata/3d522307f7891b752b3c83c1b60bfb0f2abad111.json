On April 14, the Panegyric label will reissue 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s landmark The Yes Album in CD/DVD-Audio and CD/Blu-ray packages loaded with bonus material and new stereo and surround mixes.\n\nYesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ third studio LP, The Yes Album welcomed guitarist Steve Howe to the band following the departure of Peter Banks.  Howe immediately made his presence felt, writing one original song himself (Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and contributing to the epics Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yours in No DisgraceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Starship Trooper.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½   Lengthy compositions dominated both sides of the original vinyl, with only two songs under the near-seven-minute mark: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Jon AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Venture.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  The Yes Album would also be the last album for keyboardist Tony Kaye, who would be replaced by Rick Wakeman for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next release, Fragile.\n\nDespite the comings and goings in the band, the Anderson/Howe/Kaye/Chris Squire/Bill Bruford line-up sounded in perfect harmony on The Yes Album.  They blended key elements of folk and rock into a dramatic whole, showcasing the individual membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ impeccable musicianship with adventuresome science-fiction concepts and a broad stylistic palette.  Anderson, Howe and SquireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three-part suite Ã¢â‚¬Å“Starship TrooperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½- containing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life Seeker,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“DisillusionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“WÃƒÂ¼rmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ closed Side One, while Anderson and SquireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two-part Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Seen All Good PeopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ opened Side Two.  The first part of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good People,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the chess-inspired Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your MoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (with its apparent allusions to Lewis Carroll and John Lennon) was released as a single, backed with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clap,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and has been covered numerous times over the years.\n\nThe Yes Album turned out to be the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commercial breakthrough, cracking the Top 40 in America and getting all the way to No. 4 in the United Kingdom.  It was eventually certified platinum, and has seen numerous reissues in the compact disc era including an expanded edition from Rhino in 2003.  That reissue included a studio recording of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (which was featured in a live version on the original album) as well as the unique single versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your MoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life Seeker.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]",
