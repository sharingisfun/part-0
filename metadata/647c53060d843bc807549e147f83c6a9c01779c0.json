  "description": "proudly announces\n\nThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition\n(c) CD Projekt RED\n\nrelease date ...: March 2767\nprotection .....: Steam\n# of discs .....: 1\nlanguages ......: EN/FR/DE/IT/ES/PL/RU/CZ/HU/PT-BR/\nTR/JP/KR/CN\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe player is Geralt of Rivia, a professional\nmonster slayer, a witcher. Entangled in the\npolitical turmoil that engulfed Temeria, Geralt\nhelped quell the rebellion of the Order of the\nFlaming Rose. Soon after, he saved King Foltest's\nlife when the monarch was attacked by a\nwitcher-like assassin. He continues to protect the\nking, serving as his bodyguard as Foltest strives\nto bring peace to his kingdom. The Order's last\nbastions have yielded to the royal army, yet one\nmore task remains - the Baroness La Valette\nannounced her secession from the realm, and her\nfortress must be taken. A month after the attempted\nassassination, Foltest's armies stand at the gates\nof La Valette Castle, preparing for a final\nassault. Still at Foltest's side, Geralt is among\nthem, unable to begin his personal quest to\ndiscover the mysterious assassin's origin and\nidentity... Thanks to the new, ultra-modern\nREDengine, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings\nfeatures both beautiful graphics and sophisticated\nin-game mechanics, drawing players into the most\nlively and believable world ever created in a video\ngame. Defining new standards for realistic,\nnon-linear game narration, The Witcher 2 spins a\nmature, thought-provoking tale to produce one of\nthe most complex and unique RPGs ever released on\nconsoles. In addition to its epic story, the game\nfeatures a complex combat system that uniquely\ncombines dynamic action and tactical depth.\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install the game\n3- Copy the crack from PROPHET dir to\n&lt;installdir&gt;bin folder\n4- Go To Hell!\n\nNOTE:\nText and Speech language can be selected in the\ngame launcher.",
