Divenire - Einaudi&amp;#039;s seventh studio album ? is a slight diversion in that it&amp;#039;s the first time the composer has collaborated with a full orchestra: the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic to be exact. Einaudi&amp;#039;s compelling piano pieces are still at the core of Divenire and remain as mesmerising as ever, but the orchestral embellishments lend his work a richer, more sweeping ambience. Divenire also sees Einaudi experiment with electronics, though these are used sparingly; primarily as textural devices. While not as minimal as earlier works, Divenire does not embrace the epic, preferring instead to ebb and flow gently between pared-down piano pieces and the fuller, more emotive sentiments of &quot;Primavera,&quot; or the 11-minute opus, &quot;Oltremare.&quot; Representing yet another stage in a formidably progressive career, Divenire sees Ludovico Einadi at the height of his imaginative powers. --Danny McKenna\n\nDescription\n&amp;#039;Divenire&amp;#039; is the seventh studio album from Italian pianistLudovico Einaudi. Originally conceived back in 2002 - when Einaudi was invited to compose and perform a piece for the ISuoni Delle Dolomiti festival - &amp;#039;Divenire&amp;#039; sees Einaudi backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic giving a new dimension to his minimalist and moving piano pieces.\n\nTrack Listings\n1.
