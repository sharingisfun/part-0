The player must guide Lara through\nphysics puzzles, challenging environments, and a high-octane story to\novercome a harrowing situation and make it off of the island alive.\n\nCombat - Tomb Raider is pushing the action genre forward with visceral\nthird-person combat and a deep weapon and gear upgrade system that Lara\nwill have to strategically employ to overcome increasingly difficult\nenemies and environments, all with a unique Survival Action twist.\n\nDynamic Traversal  it wouldnt be Tomb Raider without certain\nsignature elements. In addition to platforming, Lara will have to\nexplore large areas to earn experience points that will upgrade her\nweapons and gear.
