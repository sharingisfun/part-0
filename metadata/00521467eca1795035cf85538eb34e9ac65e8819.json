  "description": "The Jinx-Life &amp; Deaths Of Robert Durst - Season 1\r\n\r\nA groundbreaking six-part documentary directed and produced by Andrew Jarecki and produced and shot by Marc Smerling (the Oscar nominees behind &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot;) delves into the strange history of real estate heir Robert Durst, long suspected in the still-unsolved 1982 disappearance of his wife as well as the subsequent murders of family friend Susan Berman and neighbor Morris Black. It features an extended, revealing interview with Durst himself, with whom Jarecki developed a unique relationship following the release of &quot;All Good Things,&quot; Jarecki's 2010 feature about Durst's life starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. &quot;The Jinx&quot; results from nearly a decade of research by the filmmakers, who expose police files, key witnesses, never-before-seen footage, private prison recordings, and thousands of pages of hidden documents\r\n\r\nEp 1 - A Body in the Bay\r\nEp 2 - Poor Little Rich Boy\r\nEp 3 - The Gangster's Daughter\r\nEp 4 - The State of Texas vs. Robert Durst\r\nEp 5 - Family Values\r\nEp 6 - What The Hell Did I Do?",
