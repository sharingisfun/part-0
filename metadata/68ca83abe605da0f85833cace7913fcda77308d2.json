In the glut of hard rock and heavy metal bands of the late '70s, their first albums got somewhat lost in the shuffle, although they were fairly popular in Europe and Japan. During 1982, Coverdale took some time off so he could take care of his sick daughter. When he re-emerged with a new version of Whitesnake in 1984, the band sounded revitalized and energetic. Slide It In may have relied on Led Zeppelin's and Deep Purple's old tricks, but the band had a knack for writing hooks; the record became their first platinum album. Three years later, Whitesnake released an eponymous album (titled 1987 in Europe) that was even better. Portions of the album were blatantly derivative -- &quot;Still of the Night&quot; was a dead ringer for early Zeppelin -- but the group could write powerful, heavy rockers like &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; that were driven as much by melody as riffs, as well as hit power ballads like &quot;Is This Love.&quot; Whitesnake was an enormous international success, selling over six million copies in the U.S. alone. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Ready To Rock\n02.Best Years\n03.Still Of The Night\n04.Is This Love\n05.All For Love\n06.Love Ain't No Stranger\n07.Shake My Tree\n08.Pride And Joy\n09.Looking For Love\n10.Now You're Gone (U.S. Remix)\n11.Give Me All Your Love\n12.Fool For Your Loving\n13.The Time Is Right For Love\n14.Ready An' Willing\n15.Don't Break My Heart Again\n16.Walking In The Shadow Of The Blues (Live)\n17.'Til The End Of Time\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Can You Hear The Wind Blow\n02.Dog\n03.Here I Go Again\n04.Lay Down Your Love\n05.Judgement Day\n06.Take Me For A Little While\n07.Waiting On You\n08.Woman Trouble Blues\n09.All I Want All I Need\n10.Sailing Ships (Live)\n11.The Deeper The Love\n12.All I Want Is You\n13.Hit An' Run\n14.Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City\n15.Slow An' Easy\n16.Blindman\n\n\n\n\n         \n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
