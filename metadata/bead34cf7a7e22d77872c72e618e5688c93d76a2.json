  "description": "                                 Caesar III\n \nCaesar III is a city building and management simulation that transports players back\nto ancient Rome, letting them live the life of a provincial governor. It\\&amp;#039;s your job \nTo create an environment that will attract citizens, keep those people fed and supplied with fresh water, and defend the city walls from jealous and greedy enemies. As if that\\&amp;#039;s not enough, you also have to meet the demands of your caesar or face... dismissal.\n\nWe were eased into the career mode with a series of easy tutorials that gave us a good\nfeel for the basic game mechanics. After that the challenges were legion, but the \nrewards for good city planning and wise financial management were worth the effort.\nIt is satisfying to create a self-sufficient and profitable city that can fend off \nenemy attacks and produce productive, educated citizens.\n\nCities really come to life, thanks to the game\\&amp;#039;s detailed graphics. \nountains, statues, and gardens can be used to pretty things up, and all \nthe familiar Roman landmarks like the Colosseum and Hippodrome will eventually\nend up dominating the landscape. \nWe whiled away many hours with Caesar III\\&amp;#039;s City Construction Kit,\nwhich lets players build a city without the goals of career mode hanging over \ntheir heads. \nAny fans of the SimCity titles should enjoy Caesar III, and its unique setting \nand fun gameplay should attract even those who didn\\&amp;#039;t like that related series \nof games.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nInFo:\n\nPublisher: Sierra Entertainment\nDeveloper: Impressions Games\nGenre: Historic City-Building\nRelease Date: Sep 30, 1998\nESRB: EVERYONE\nESRB Descriptors: Mild Animated Violence \n\nMinimum System Requirements\nSystem: Pentium-90 or equivalent\nRAM: 16 MB\nVideo Memory: 1 MB \nTested and working on Vista, so should work without any problems on Xp.\n*I have also included scans of the cover and cd.\n\nReview;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/caesar3/index.html?tag=result;title;0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/caesar3/index.html?tag=result;title;0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInStRuCtIoNs:\n\nExtract the archive with latest Winrar or 7zip.\nStart game with c3.exe in game folder.\nPlay!\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n",
