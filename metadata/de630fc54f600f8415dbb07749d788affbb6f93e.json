  "description": "Charles Bradley\nNo Time For Dreaming (2011)\n\n\n\n\nSoul and R&amp;B singer Charles Bradley definitely didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t arrive as a recording artist by taking the easy route. Born in Gainesville, FL in 1948, but raised in Brooklyn, NY, Bradley spent a good part of his childhood living on the streets. A transformational moment came when his sister took him to see James Brown at the Apollo in 1962. Bradley was struck by Brown's energy and stage manner, and began practicing microphone tricks with a broom at home, dreaming of being a star on his own stage, and it was a dream he would never abandon in spite of all sorts of mishaps, misdirects, and general hard times.\n\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tDunham\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.The World (Is Going Up In Flames)\n02.The Telephone Song\n03.Golden Rule\n04.I Believe In Your Love\n05.Trouble In The Land\n06.Lovin' You, Baby\n07.No Time For Dreaming\n08.How Long\n09.In You (I Found A Love)\n10.Why Is It So Hard\n11.Since Our Last Goodbye\n12.Heartaches And Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n",
