  "description": "This is a microsoft downloaded ISO that was updated via wintoolkit to september 28 2014. NOTHING was changed. Everything was left as it was from microsoft. the only thing i did was intergrate the updates and compile the ISO. \n\nbecause of the size of the updates that were integrated you will need an 8gb usb drive to install. use the free and dependable windows usb tool. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool&lt;/a&gt;\nits from microsoft and will flash the iso into the usb you chose and that usb becomes an install drive for windows 7 pro 64bit, updated.\n\nit takes about an hour and half to update the iso that microsoft provides after installation, this will save you that time.\n\nNO CHANGES WERE MADE! only updated. \n\nif anyone needs a different version updated, let me know. i can upload it since i have almost every version updated. i do more than 200 installs a week, so it saves me time. i dont mind sharing.",
