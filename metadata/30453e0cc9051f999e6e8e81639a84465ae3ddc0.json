It appeared the 44-year-old alcoholic, having slipped into a booze-and-pill stupor, drowned in her own bathwater. The death was ruled accidental by the authorities. In the months that followed, however, police were alerted to rumours and reports that the teenagers had been gossiping to friends about the accident. Police began piecing together rumours that suggested the teens might have had a hand in their mother's death. In fact, rather than an accident, the story that emerged portrayed the two teens as cold-blooded, premeditated killers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30453e0cc9051f999e6e8e81639a84465ae3ddc0","amp;dn":"Perfect+Sisters+%282014%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30453e0cc9051f999e6e8e81639a84465ae3ddc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,69,62,12,201,5,31,153,158,110,142,129,99,154,132,70,90,227,221,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
