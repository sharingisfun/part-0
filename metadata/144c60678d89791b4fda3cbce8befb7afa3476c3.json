The massive selection of third party libraries make it suitable for a wide range of applications. This also allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in similar languages. The availability of high quality numerically-focused tools has made Python an excellent choice for high performance computing. The speed of applications comes down to how well the code is written. Poorly written code means poorly performing applications, which means unsatisfied customers.\n\nThis book is an example-oriented guide to the techniques used to dramatically improve the performance of your Python programs. It will teach optimization techniques by using pure python tricks, high performance libraries, and the python-C integration. The book will also include a section on how to write and run parallel code.\n\nThis book will teach you how to take any program and make it run much faster. You will learn state-of the art techniques by applying them to practical examples. This book will also guide you through different profiling tools which will help you identify performance issues in your program. You will learn how to speed up your numerical code using NumPy and Cython. The book will also introduce you to parallel programming so you can take advantage of modern multi-core processors.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:144c60678d89791b4fda3cbce8befb7afa3476c3","amp;dn":"Python+High+Performance+Programming+%2C+2013+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"144c60678d89791b4fda3cbce8befb7afa3476c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,76,96,103,141,137,121,27,79,218,60,188,232,190,251,122,250,52,118,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
