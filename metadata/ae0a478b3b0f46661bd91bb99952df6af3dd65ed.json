Follow it and you will succeed-just like the hundreds of thousands of beginners Zed has taught to date! You bring the discipline, commitment, and persistence; the author supplies everything else.\n\nIn Learn Python the Hard Way, Third Edition, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn Python by working through 52 brilliantly crafted exercises. Read them. Type their code precisely. (No copying and pasting!) Fix your mistakes. Watch the programs run. As you do, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how software works; what good programs look like; how to read, write, and think about code; and how to find and fix your mistakes using tricks professional programmers use. Most importantly, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the following, which you need to start writing excellent Python software of your own:\n\n- Installing a complete Python environment\n- Organizing and writing code\n- Basic mathematics\n- Variables\n- Strings and text\n- Interacting with users\n- Working with files\n- Looping and logic\n- Data structures using lists and dictionaries\n- Program design\n- Object-oriented programming\n- Inheritance and composition\n- Modules, classes, and objects\n- Python packaging\n- Debugging\n- Automated testing\n- Basic game development\n- Basic web development\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be hard at first. But soon, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just get it-and that will feel great!\n\nThis tutorial will reward you for every minute you put into it. Soon, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful, popular programming languages. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be a Python programmer.\n\nWatch Zed, too! The accompanying DVD contains 5+ hours of passionate, powerful teaching: a complete Python video course!\n\nTable of Contents\nExercise 1. A Good First Program\nExercise 2.
