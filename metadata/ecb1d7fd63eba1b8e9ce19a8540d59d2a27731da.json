  "description": "Aretha Franklin\n30 Greatest Hits\nRemastered (2000)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nAretha Franklin is one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged. Her astonishing run of late-'60s hits with Atlantic Records -- &quot;Respect,&quot; &quot;I Never Loved a Man,&quot; &quot;Chain of Fools,&quot; &quot;Baby I Love You,&quot; &quot;I Say a Little Prayer,&quot; &quot;Think,&quot; &quot;The House That Jack Built,&quot; and several others -- earned her the title &quot;Lady Soul,&quot; which she has worn uncontested ever since. Yet as much of an international institution as she's become, much of her work -- outside of her recordings for Atlantic in the late '60s and early '70s -- is erratic and only fitfully inspired, making discretion a necessity when collecting her records. \n\nGenre................: R&amp;B/Soul\nSource...............: CD {Atlantic 81668-2}\nYear.................: 2000\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You)\n02.Respect\n03.Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\n04.Dr. Feelgood\n05.Save Me\n06.Baby I Love You\n07.(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\n08.Chain Of Fools\n09.Since You've Been Gone\n10.Ain't No Way\n11.Think\n12.I Say A Little Prayer\n13.The House That Jack Built\n14.See Saw\n15.The Weight\n16.Share Your Love With Me\n17.Eleanor Rigby\n\nCD2\n\n01.Call Me\n02.Spirit In The Dark\n03.Don't Play That Song\n04.You're All I Need To Get By\n05.Bridge Over Troubled Water\n06.Spanish Harlem\n07.Rock Steady\n08.Oh Me Oh My (I'm A Fool For You Baby)\n09.Day Dreaming\n10.Wholy Holy\n11.Angel\n12.Until You Come Back To Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)\n13.I'm In Love\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...",
