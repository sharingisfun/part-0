  "description": "\n\n\n\nThe Morrow Guide to Knots: for Sailing, Fishing, Camping, Climbing \n\n\nCollins Reference \nMario Bigon , Guido Regazzoni  \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0688012264\nISBN-13: 978-0688012267 \n256 pages \nPDF \n58.2 MB\n\nHere is an entirely different kind of knot book! For the first time, here are step-by-step instructions that take full advantage of color photography to teach the art of tying knots. Unlike illustrations in other books, these pictures show every step looking over the shoulder of the tier -- the way you see the knot as you make it. And when two or more ropes are involved, they are color coded so you can clearly tell them apart.\n\nIncluded in addition are a section on decorative knots, a cross-reference list of the many applications of knots, and a detailed glossary. The Morrow Guide to Knots is a reliable and essential reference tool for all sportsmen and campers, homeowners, and youngsters as well.\n\n\n\n\n",
