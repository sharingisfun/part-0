After completion of the 6-year-old war between the neighboring states and the Communist Kolechia Arstotzka, the last half of the required border town called Grestin ... Among the crowd of immigrants and want to earn extra money, may be hiding smugglers, spies and terrorists. Guided only by the documents and primitive computer, you decide who can enter Arstotzka, and who will be expelled or arrested.\n\nExtras. information:\nPapers, Please (Ã‚Â«Papers, please&quot;) - a computer game created by indie developer Lucas Pope and released August 8, 2013 for Windows and Mac OS X through the distribution system Steam.\n\nThe plot unfolds in 1982 around the immigration officer a fictitious country Arstottski with the communist regime. On the eve of Arstottska opens its borders to foreigners, and the player must make a decision to let foreign guest (or returning compatriot) or not. For adjudication should be consulted with undocumented migrants and try to identify inconsistencies. If all of the documents in order, the migrant can skip to the country.\n\nNecessary to solve moral dilemmas: for example, the old man always goes with obviously forged documents. To give him the heave-ho, or pity, and skip to the criminals do not &quot;milked&quot; it? Hubby documents are in order, and the wife is not - whether or not to pass? If we manage to hold out for long, the player appears gun that can shoot the intruder before he would arrange the attack; through the checkpoint start walking provocateurs and supervisors. On the last day the situation is heating so that provocateurs decide to undermine the CAT, and it depends on you, on whose side you're on. All in the game twenty endings: sixteen - game over, winning three and one - a partial win.\n\nThe game has seven achievements (&quot;chips&quot;), the number of countries. Badges are given for the selfless assistance to a particular immigrant example, Obristana badge - if you ever miss the old man said (he appears constantly, and sometimes his papers are in perfect order). In Steam-version has a few more hidden achievements.\n\nThe first mention of the fictional country was in a small game The Republia Times, written by Lucas Pope on Adobe Flash for competition Ludum Dare.\n\nSubsequently, Pope wrote a play Papers, Please in the same fictional world. The game is written in an open programming language HaXe using an open framework NME. Pope, as an American living in Japan, because of what always had difficulties in international travel, which served as the basis for the game's plot.\nApril 11, 2013 the game was sent to the service Steam Greenlight, after which the community was approved on May 1.\nCollecting money for the development, Pope asked people to send in their names-names. Among other things, the game includes a roll of wallpaper (a parody of the Chechen and Dagestani s) and Holovatch Lena (taboo homophone). Subsequently, these jokes removed.\nSome users have problems, so the game went to the NME on OpenGL.\nPapers, Please was positively received by critics leading gaming publications, Metacritic rating of the game is 85%.\n\nreview\nOn the border of clouds go sullenly: simulator ruthless bureaucratic machine somewhere in Eastern Europe 80. And of course, the story of a little man.\n\nThe protagonist of the Papers, Please - unnamed employee of passport control at the only open PPC linking fictional country Arstottska neighbors. Is 1982, the Cold War is in full swing, and Arstottska, apparently located somewhere in Eastern Europe, where everything is twice as depressive than elsewhere. Across the border crammed with terrorists, smugglers and refugees, to the checkpoint there is a turn in three rows, but on the day goes on the strength of ten men.\n\nPlace and time, despite the obvious historical parallels, it does not matter. Political showdown reach the hero in the form of newspaper headlines and just means that today, for example, the authorities forbid let across the border citizens Idora. Or that all citizens need to scour Kolechii. Acts of terrorism, as a rule, only end badly for the border guards with machine guns; for the clerk with a set of stamps which means that from the service today will have to leave early, and he will earn less money - then pay for the amount of processed passports. Controller not to geopolitics, his whole world are desk, window, wall and in front of forty meters around - twenty in both sides of the border. Left - the endless queue of asylum, the right - tommy and the road that sometimes comes bosses. In the center of the universe - the sullen faces and paper, paper, paper.\n\nWith each passing day the conditions of the boundary change - usually in the direction of complexity. At first, entering only check the passport, but then the bureaucratic machine is gaining momentum, and begins: there are some entry permits, identification cards for all occasions, accompanying biometric profiles, work permits ... In all these documents need to check the print pictures, names, places and dates of issue of action - all in order to put in a red or green passport stamp. Bosses forgives no more than two errors per day - then start penalties.\n\nHero Papers Please - a little man, whose image is simultaneously reminiscent of Gogol, Kafka and Orwell. In fact, he was not even a person, but the frame of the circumstances close the service jacket, which can be any (in fact, the hero and title of a win in the local &quot;labor lottery&quot;). That is why it is very easy to identify themselves. Once this occurs - for strength tests begin. Pervosti follow instructions is not too difficult, but it should be done quickly - depends on earnings and, as a consequence, the family wealth. It does not show in the picture, but between levels regularly reminded that his wife and mother-in-law are cold, my uncle is bent, and the child is about a birthday and he wants to import a box of pencils.\n\nAfter a couple of days of bureaucratic procedures becomes so much that delve into each individual case has already once: just to process the documents, put a stamp and have time to shout &quot;next.&quot; &quot;At home, I will be killed! - Entry permit overdue. Next! &quot;; &quot;I need her doctor is only in Arstottske! - In the photograph in the passport are not you. Next! &quot;. It sounds cruel, but cruelty turns into a necessity, given that the daily wage is often enough only for one thing - heating or food. And in the court of November. Do not ask.\n\nMoney all the time a little, so indifference quickly turns into cynicism. You can take bribes to send offenders to prison for &quot;kickbacks&quot; escorts. You can take a pledge heirlooms and resell them, while the owner sweats, collecting documents for entry, and give a small businessman ushlogo a visiting engineers. Tellingly, the chance to sacrifice themselves for the sake of a better future for the family and fatherland also be presented. The question is whether you will be able to use it. For example, I failed in the month, work mode, I turned into a craven aphids and the hand at the last moment wavered.\n\nThis is probably the most surprising property of Papers, Please. Simulator boring profession, almost no graphics, gameplay pro comparison of numbers and stamps - manages to perform with your subconscious amazing things. This game is about the circumstances that are stronger than men and at the same time - a test to determine moral character. As Cart Life, only cooler: here decay and despair in your life are closely intertwined with the hopelessness in the lives of dozens of people on the left of the border post. So the next time, returning with some of the resort, you will see at the airport brick face passport control officer, not a nuisance that it is slow and frowned looking at you. It's not he is.
