Mike Carey, Peter Gross and Scott Hampton combine to explore the life of Lucifer Morningstar and the interesting path he travels. Promotional info for the first collected volume - &quot;Cast out of Heaven, thrown down to rule in Hell, Lucifer Morningstar has resigned his post and abandoned his kingdom for the mortal city of Los Angles. Emerging from the pages of writer Neil Gaiman's award-winning series The Sandman, the former Lord of Hell is now enjoying a quiet retirement as the propretor of Lux, L.A.'s most elite piano bar.\nBut now an assignment from the Creator Himself is going to change all that.\nIf Lucifer agrees to do Heaven's dirty work, he can name his own price--but both the task and reward are more than they seem. Thrown into a position of great threat and ultimate opportunity, Lucifer knows that threading a path through this maze will require the harshest of sacrifices.&quot;\n\nThis is every issue of the series in digital, thanks to Empire. I have also made sure that the fixed versions of issues 26, 30, and 34 are in here in lieu of the earlier versions. Much love to Empire for these awesome copies, please seed and enjoy! :-)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f83dbcc9c10ee7c792e09cd110e1bb95cfe59671","amp;dn":"Lucifer+01-75+%282000-2006%7CDigital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f83dbcc9c10ee7c792e09cd110e1bb95cfe59671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,61,188,201,193,14,231,199,146,224,156,209,16,225,187,149,207,229,150,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
