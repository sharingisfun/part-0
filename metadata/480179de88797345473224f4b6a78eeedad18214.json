  "description": "Professional Home Design Software\n\nFor all aspects of residential and light commercial design. As you draw walls and place smart architectural objects like doors and windows, the program creates a 3D model, generates a Materials List, and with the use of powerful building tools, helps produce Construction Documents with Site Plans, Framing Plans, Section Details, and Elevations.\n\nBuilding &amp; Design Tools\n\nUse powerful building and drafting tools to quickly create plans according to standard building practices and make the design process efficient and productive. Automatic and Manual Building tools allow you to create a variety of Roof styles, Stairs, Framing - both stick and truss, Schedules and Materials Lists for Cut, Buy and Estimating, Dimensioning, Cross-Sections, Elevations and CAD tools. .\n\nKitchen, Bath &amp; Interior Design\n\nChief Architect uses smart design objects, such as cabinets, to quickly and easily create various styles, shapes and sizes. Chief Architect partners with specific manufacturers (cabinets, appliances, doors, windows, countertops and flooring) so that styles, finishes and other product-specific design details can be accurately drawn and rendered. \n\n3D Design and Modeling Tools\n\nAs you draw walls, the program automatically creates a 3D model and supports full 3D editing. With Chief Architect, you can design in any view for seamless and simultaneous editing between 2D &amp; 3D. Advanced rendering provides both Photo Realistic and Artistic styles such as Line Drawing and Watercolor. An extensive 3D Library of architectural objects and tools make it easy to detail and accessorize your designs so that styles, finishes and other product-specific design details can be accurately rendered.\n\nCAD Tools for Productivity &amp; Precision\n\nChief Architect has a powerful CAD software engine that includes tools for lines, polylines, splines, arcs and solids to produce objects that range from custom entry columns to a deck ledger detail. Quickly manipulate objects with multiple copy, align, reflect and replicate at specific intervals. A CAD-to-Walls tool imports AutoCADÃ‚Â® files and provides mapping for layers so you can quickly see the model in 3D. Draw custom CAD details, import as DWG/DXF/PDF, or choose from over 500 CAD details built into Chief Architect.\n\nPlans Sets &amp; Construction Drawings\n\n3D renderings and virtual tours help you sell the project and construction drawings help you specify, permit and build. All views in your project - Floor Plans, Framing, Electrical, Section Details and Elevations have a user defined scale and link to a specific drawing that updates as your design changes. Layers control what displays for each of the drawing pages to help create professional detailed construction drawings.\n\nSite Planning, Terrain, Decks &amp; Landscaping\n\nCreate site plans for single or multiple lots. Import terrain survey data or create with the Terrain Modeling tools - terrain data can then be used for a 2D site plan or viewed in 3D to show the specific topology. Road, Sidewalk, Hill and Valley tools provide added detail. For Landscaping, there's over 4,000 plants with detailed information about each plant including integrated Hardiness Zone Maps. Define a North pointer and seasonal settings for shadow effects and overlays. Decking tools include automatic and manual deck framing; customize deck planking and materials.\n\nChief Architect Premier X6 NEW FEATURES\n\nSupport for Multiple Monitors. Tabbed view windows can be torn or undocked from main user interface and moved between monitors independently\n\nImproved User Interface. Independent Control of Library Browser and Project Browser. View the Library Browser and the Project Browser as tabs of the same window, or undock them to view them as a separate window. New Tool Palettes. When you highlight a tool, you will see all of the child tools in the Tool Palette\n\nLayout Page Index and Revision Index. Create an index of drawing sheets and their revisions. Specify page attributes such as Label, Title, Description, Revision Information, and Comments for each sheet in the Layout Page Information Dialog.\n\nCrop Picture Images added to Plan and Layout.

Specify multiple Template pages in a Layout and assign individual pages to reference a template\n\nControl the Order of Objects in Schedules. Re-order items by row or column in a schedule. The schedule number updates correspondingly in the plan\n\nReal-Time Reflections and Shadows in Render Views. The standard render camera (OpenGL) generates reflections and shadows quickly, as you navigate your design\n\nSave Image Settings with Ray Trace Configurations. Preserve settings like tone mapping, intensity, contrast, and saturation to reuse in ray traces\n\nImport plans from Chief ArchitectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Room PlannerÃ¢â€žÂ¢ mobile app. Create designs using Room PlannerÃ¢â€žÂ¢, then import them into Chief Architect for editing and detailing\n\nAuto Refresh Exterior Dimensions.
