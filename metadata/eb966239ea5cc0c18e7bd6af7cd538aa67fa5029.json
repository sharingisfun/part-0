  "description": "Mathematica 10, downloaded from the Wolfram site.\n\nThis includes AGAiN's keygen for Mathematica 9, which still works for 10. Same drill as before, but just in case;\n\n1. Install the program, then run it. It will ask you to activate.\n\n2. Click &quot;Other ways to activate&quot;, or something like that, and pick &quot;Manual&quot;.\n\n3. Enter your Math ID into the Keygen, and click &quot;Save Mathpass&quot;.\n\n4. Copy the resulting activation key and password, and accept the agreement.\n\n5. Congrats, you have the program!\n\nIf you're having problems, you probably wrote your Math ID in the keygen wrong. MAKE SURE YOU ENTERED IT IN CORRECTLY. This is the main reason people have problems. Check, then re-check. It should work.\n\nLast time I posted version 9, the keygen didn't work 100% of the time. It always worked for me, but some people had trouble. Trust me, it works. Just keep trying, it will work eventually.\n\nIf you have the money and you like the product, buy it yourself. http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica-home-edition/\n\nFAQ\n\nQ : Which version of Mathematica is this?\n\nA : There are three versions of Mathematica 10. One for Windows, one for Mac, and one for Linux. This is the Windows version. The .exe contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The supposed different versions advertised on the site (Home ed. vs. Student ed. etc.) are different licenses, not different programs. There is only one version for your OS.\n\nI will also post the Linux version along with this one.\n\nQ : Does natural language/Wolfram|Alpha work?\n\nA : Yes, it does. Large data requests require credits, but smaller requests, such as country data, chemical data, and natural language interpretation, all work.\n\nQ : Wasn't this released literally yesterday?\n\nA : Yes. I dread the day that Wolfram catches on. Or maybe they have and don't care. That'd be pretty cool.\n\nQ : What are the new features?\n\nA : See here: http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-10/\n\nI personally like the computational geometry and the machine learning (gets my clit hard). But the real headliner, the biggest Mathematica revolution to ever hit the earth, is by far this;\n\nMultiple undo. Need I say more?",
