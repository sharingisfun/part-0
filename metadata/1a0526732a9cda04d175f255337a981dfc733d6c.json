  "description": "It is French Colonial Vietnam in 1929. A young French girl from a family that is having some monetary difficulties is returning to boarding school. She is alone on public transportation when she catches the eye of a wealthy Chinese businessman. He offers her a ride into town in the back of his chauffeured sedan, and sparks fly. Can the torrid affair that ensues between them overcome the class restrictions and social mores of that time? Based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Maugerite Duras.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101316/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101316/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast \n\tJane March\t... \tThe Young Girl\n\tTony Leung Ka Fai\t... \tThe Chinaman\n\tFrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©rique Meininger\t... \tThe Mother\n\tArnaud Giovaninetti\t... \tThe Elder Brother\n\tMelvil Poupaud\t... \tThe Younger Brother\n\tLisa Faulkner\t... \tHelene Lagonelle\n\tXiem Mang\t... \tThe Chinaman&amp;#039;s Father\n\tPhilippe Le Dem\t... \tThe French Teacher\n\tAnn Schaufuss\t... \tAnne-Marie Stretter\n\tQuach Van An\t... \tThe Driver\n\tTania Torrens\t... \tThe Principal\n\tRaymonde Heudeline\t... \tThe Writer (end)\n\tYvonne Wingerter\t... \tThe Writer (beginning)\n\tDo Minh Vien\t... \tThe Young Boy\n\tHÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨ne Patarot\t... \tThe Assistant Mistress\n\nJean-Jacques Annaud&amp;#039;s film version of Marguerite Duras, one of France&amp;#039;s most esteemed writers, is quite erotic... told from the perspective of a 15-and-a-half-year-old French girl, who learns very early about passion, love and heartbreak... \n\nIt&amp;#039;s the crossing of the river... The crossing, on a ferry, of one of the branches of the Mekong, in the great plains of mud and rice of southern Indochina... \n\nA pretty young girl goes back to Saigon... She is standing on the deck, extremely defiant, wearing a silk dress, a pair of &amp;#039;cabaret&amp;#039; high heels, and a man&amp;#039;s hat... She is approached by an elegant dark man from Cholon who is also crossing the Mekong that day towards Saigon... &amp;#039;I like your hat. It&amp;#039;s original. A man&amp;#039;s hat on a young girl,&amp;#039; he expresses, and continues: &amp;#039;If you want I can drive you to Saigon.&amp;#039;\n\nThe rich Chinese playboy with a black Rolls-Royce is 32 years old, from that financial minority that owns all the popular housing of the colony... He&amp;#039;s back from Paris where he undertook some business studies...\n\nThe film, beautifully shot, is a dreamy fantasy of escape through sex... The escape is that of the poor French teenager from the horror of her house in Sa-Dec... While the girl merely abides her innocent mother, she loves her younger brother poetically, without reserve... Her brother is handsome but not bright, romantic but terribly fragile... She fears her elder brother, a brutal and lawless dissolute man, stupidly dependent on his mother... The inexperienced girl wants to see him in pain... \n\nThe most remarkable aspect of the story is the strength of character of the young girl who is always a little sad... She finds the strength to proceed against the forbidden with a calm determination... &quot;I&amp;#039;ve never followed anyone into a room yet.,&quot; she exclaims... \n\nThe room was dark, shipwrecked, surrounded by the never-ending clamor of the town, carried away by the flow of the town... Her body was in that public noise... Their love was erotic, immediate, unrestrained... It was physical, violent, devastating... \n\nBut the girl loves other young woman in the boarding house, the 17-year-old Helen... Her passion for Helene is intense... Helen is immodest... She don&amp;#039;t realize she walks naked in the dormitory... She doesn&amp;#039;t know that she&amp;#039;s very beautiful... She&amp;#039;s innocent lingering on in youth... \n\n&amp;#039;The Lover&amp;#039; parallels the life of Duras herself... The setting, in Indochina, is one she knows intimately... The story is set mostly in the early 1920s following the decline of French domination of the territory that is now Vietnam... The film is the most exciting journey along a winding river of passion, which ultimately flows to the sea... \n\nJean-Jacques Annaud handles the story with real sensuality, romance and dramatic power... He shots much of the film with a distinguished style...\n\nJane March is attractive, but not obviously beautiful... Her impressionable teenager&amp;#039;s gradual understanding of sexuality is well presented... She was subjected to a close, penetrating gaze by Annaud&amp;#039;s camera..\n\nTony Leung, as the rich Chinaman, is the lusty son unable to escape his family&amp;#039;s commands...\n\nAlthough unseen, Jeanne Moreau jaded voice narrates the action and imparts a special flavor... Her words are poetry, as any Duras reader knows...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaning behind the scenes, I first saw this movie when I was younger, as one of the most graphic &quot;mainstream&quot; movies available. That was before I ever knew what the word &quot;soft-core&quot; meant.\n\nI watched it again, when I was older, and I finally understand it. The quiet sequences and unemotional facade of the female lead are no longer just boring filler between the exciting love scenes. Perhaps it&amp;#039;s because I needed a little more life experience to know the unexpressed feelings of the female character and the expressed feelings of the male character. Sure, this movie is about taboo and tasting forbidden fruit. This movie is about sex. But this movie also has very strong depictions of the other emotions involved in the affair. Shame. Guilt. Racial and social prejudice. Love which is explored when both parties know there can be no future. Emotional detachment born out of necessity, as a &quot;defense mechanism&quot;. Being ostracized by your peers, and life in an environment rife with vicious rumors. But mostly the shame and guilt. It&amp;#039;s made clearer to me what a former lover of mine may have felt.\n\nTo live through all that and then to watch this movie makes for a very personal, moving experience. I can&amp;#039;t recommend it to everyone, since every movie experience is unique. But I can say that &quot;The Lover&quot; is much, much more than just an excuse for graphic love scenes. It&amp;#039;s a story of a reminiscence... a first time... a shameful secret... a hidden love, fostered through hardship and burning into the mind of the narrator an indelible, permanent mark of memory of a first, life-shaping lover...",
