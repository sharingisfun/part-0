  "description": "Snes Station for Ps2 ( http://snes-station.gamebase.ca/ ) . I made this Image with Nero, but you can use any program to burn it, as long as it burns image files. I use Dvd Decrypter which is free and is found here http://dvd-decrypter.en.softonic.com/ \nI suggest you burn this to DVD, as I did not test this with a CD-R. It was made for DVD so Burn It to a DVD. You can play it on PS2 assuming you have a ps2 that has a MOD-CHIP or you are using a SWAP DISC and some kind of boot method.\nHas All the US roms ever released.",
