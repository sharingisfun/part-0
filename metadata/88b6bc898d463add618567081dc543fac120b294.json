  "description": "Down The Way, the new album from Aussie siblings Angus and Julia Stone and their first since 2007's exquisite debut A Book Like This, is now on the release schedule for a March 30 street via Nettwerk/Sony. Brad Albetta, best known for his work with Martha Wainwright, produced with the duo. &quot;All the songs were written so far away from each other that the styles and moods are really different,&quot; explains Angus of the album, a writing process that is unlike most duos since they each compose their works individually and often simply switch off to each other, live and in the studio, as two solo performers sharing a stage might do.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Hold On\n2 Black Crow\n3 For You\n4 Big Jet Plane\n5 Santa Monica Dream\n6 Yellow Brick Road\n7 And The Boys\n8 On The Road\n9 Walk It Off\n10 Hush\n11 Draw Your Swords\n11 I'm Not Yours\n12 The Devil's Tears (incl. hidden track)\n\nSeed and comment please! I love seeing that people who make use of my torrents actually exist as people who speak :)",
