  "description": "Clear and Simple, the .MOBI eBook file of the book. My first torrent, go easy on me.\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place. \n\nLike most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. \n\nAnd like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortuneÃ¢â‚¬â€and remarkable powerÃ¢â‚¬â€to whoever can unlock them.   \n\nFor years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that HallidayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riddles are based in the pop culture he lovedÃ¢â‚¬â€that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of HallidayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John HughesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.\n\nAnd then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.\n\nSuddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the huntÃ¢â‚¬â€among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and loveÃ¢â‚¬â€in the real world heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been so desperate to escape. \n \nA world at stake.\nA quest for the ultimate prize.\nAre you ready?",
