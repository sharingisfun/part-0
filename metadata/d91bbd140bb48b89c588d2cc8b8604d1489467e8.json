  "description": "Windows 7 Activator RemoveWAT v2.2.6.0 by Hazar\n\n\nThis is the latest version downloaded from Hazar's Forum. All credits go to him...\n\n\nHazar's comment:\n\n\nWORKS ON ALL EDITIONS OF 7/R2!\n\nNOT FOR VISTA/ORIGINAL SERVER 2008!!!!\n\nThis is a little tool I put together to remove WAT, with help from various others, (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining genuine status and receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Security Essentials.\n\n\nFeature list:\nRequires no additional processes running after patching\nHas a theoretical 100% success rate due to it being hardware independent\nEffeciently coded with safety checks to prevent damage to a Windows installation\nUninstall option\nComplete removal of all genuine related elements visible to the user, whilst keeping the core activation system active, allowing you to pass various genuine checks without issue\nProgress bar to allow overview of completion time\nA completley safe solution with zero risk of bricking your bootsector or rendering your pc unbootable.\n\n\nDue to my lack of time at the moment, BobSheep has kindly fixed the problems in this version as a temporary solution\n\n\nOriginal Post and link here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/10895-RemoveWAT-A-safer-activation-solution.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/10895-RemoveWAT-A-safer-activation-solution.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing the program you find it useful, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n",
