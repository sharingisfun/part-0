  "description": "                            Magic Bullet Denoiser 1.0                         \n\n\n                           ##### MAC AND WINDOWS #####\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/DeGun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/DeGun&lt;/a&gt;    \n \nState-of-the-art video noise reduction, out of the box\n\nDon't settle for noisy video. \n\nMagic Bullet Denoiser does it allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½professional results with no fuss. Traditional noise removal methods can blur fine detail, but Denoiser's advanced technology retains definition while eliminating noise.\n\n\nHighlights\n\nNo Noise, No Fuss\n\nApply Denoiser and get results immediately. Tell Magic Bullet Denoiser whether camera motion is slow or fast, set a single slider, and you're ready to go. Denoiser is faster than After Effects' built-in de-noising feature, and yields superior results with less blurring and better preservation of fine details.\n\nHigh-Quality Results\n\nNoisy, grainy footage distracts viewers from the story you're trying to tell. Don't worry about low light: keep shooting, knowing that you can make that video clean and smooth when you're safely back indoors. Magic Bullet Denoiser delivers results that surpass the rest.\n\nPowerful Motion Estimation\n\nHigh-speed camera movements require different handling than slow pans. Denoiser compares successive frames to learn what's natural motion in the scene and what's noise, preserving detail even in fast-moving action sequences. If you'd like to fine-tune the controls, you can set sample frames, change offsets, or enhance shadow or highlight regions.\n\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/DeGun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/DeGun&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOne-Step Noise Reduction\nDenoiser works so well out of the box, you might never need to use the individual control sliders\n\n\nMotion Estimation For High- and Low-Motion footage\nDenoiser's unique technology compares where pixels have moved between frames to discriminate between what's actual noise and what is natural motion in the scene, preserving fine detail even in high-motion shots.\n\nSmart Noise Fingerprinting\nMultiple blocks in the image are analyzed to build a noise fingerprint. Set the slider to a higher value to tell Denoiser to look for more noise.\n\nFine Tuning\nPull out individual channels to fine-tune noise reduction without exposing banding artifacts with the unique chroma smoothing control\n \n\nSeparate film and video modes\nVideo mode allows you to fine-tune luma and chroma offset and chroma smoothing, while film mode (ideal for material that was originally shot on film) offers separate adjustments for red, green, and blue channel offsets\n\nShadow highlighting\nFocus noise reduction on shadows or highlights (or de-emphasize them)\n\nOne Step Image Enhancement\nRestore detail and fine edges with built-in image sharpening.\n\n\n                       &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/DeGun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/DeGun&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nF A Q : \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/magic-bullet-denoiser/more-info/35/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/magic-bullet-denoiser/more-info/35/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n     ######################  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  ######################  \n\nSEE MORE HERE : \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/magic-bullet-denoiser/compatibility/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/magic-bullet-denoiser/compatibility/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOur tests have shown that our products perform best when used with the system configurations listed below.
