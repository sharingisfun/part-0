This collection is a dream come true for any fan of R &amp; B music.\n\nWhy this list was created: \n\nTwo reasons:\n\n1. Lots of baby makin' and love makin'\n2. Looking at other 'best of' lists for R &amp; B, I was unable to find anything that was a remotely accurate collection of the greatest modern R &amp; B. I am the creator of the Top 1000 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs also, so I decided to also create a list of the truly classic R &amp; B.\n\nHow this list was created:\n\nThe range of 1987 to 2009 was used so that this list was focused on modern R &amp; B, staying away from the real classics like Marvin Gaye and the Temptations. Examples of what type of R &amp; B was used for this list are Usher, Ginuwine, Monica, TLC, Maxwell, Keith Sweat, 112, Mary J. Blige. \n\nIt is impossible to include every deserving song. Even more impossible to order them in a way to please all. Comments and props are appreciated. Please take into consideration the time and experience it took to create this torrent.\n\nThe complete 250 list:\n\n#001-#050\n\n001. Maxwell - This Woman's Work (1997)\n002. Keith Sweat - Nobody ft.
