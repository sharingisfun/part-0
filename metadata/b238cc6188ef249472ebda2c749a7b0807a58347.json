  "description": "The West Wing is an American television serial drama created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC from September 22, 1999 to May 14, 2006. The series is set in the West Wing of the White HouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior staff are locatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½during the fictional Democratic administration of Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen).\n\nThe West Wing was produced by Warner Bros. Television. For the first four seasons, there were three executive producers, Aaron Sorkin (lead writer of almost all those first four seasons), Thomas Schlamme and John Wells. After Sorkin left the program, John Wells became the sole executive producer.\n\nIt first aired on NBC in 1999, and has been broadcast by many networks in several other countries. The series ended its seven-year run on May 14, 2006.\n\nThe show received positive reviews from critics, political science professors, and former White House staffers. In total, The West Wing won three Golden Globe Awards and 27 Emmy Awards, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series, which it won four consecutive times from 2000 through 2003. The show's ratings waned in later years, following the departure of series creator Aaron Sorkin (who wrote or co-wrote 85 of the first 88 episodes) after the fourth season, yet it remained popular among high-income viewers, with around 16 million viewers, a key demographic for the show and its advertisers.\n\n\nAll files are DVDRip and in English + all extra's from all seasons. This is the most complete collection on the internet. Please seed.",
