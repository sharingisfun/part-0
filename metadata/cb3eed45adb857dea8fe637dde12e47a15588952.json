As BublÃƒÂ© eagerly absorbed the recordings, he began to realize that he wanted to be a singer and that this style of music, virtually foreign to his own generation, was what he wanted to perform. With his grandfather's assistance, BublÃƒÂ© soon learned a whole catalog of tunes and gained experience and exposure by singing as a guest with several local bands. While still in his teen years, he won the Canadian Youth Talent Search, released several independent albums, and performed in a musical revue titled Swing that traveled across the U.S. It wasn't long before BublÃƒÂ© was introduced to Grammy-winning producer David Foster and signed his first major recording contract with Reprise Records. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\nFLAC (Lossless)\n\t\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nMichael BublÃƒÂ© (2003)\n\nCome Fly With Me (2004)\n\nSings Totally Blonde (2004)\n\nCaught In The Act (2005)\n\nIt's Time [Special Edition] (2005)\n\nSeptember Room (2005)\n\nWith Love (2006)\n\nCall Me Irresponsible [Special Edition] (2007)\n\nLet It Snow!
