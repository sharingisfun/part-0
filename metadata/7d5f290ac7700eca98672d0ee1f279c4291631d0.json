  "description": "A tiny update to Alpha15b has been released that fixes a small bug with Cassandra Classic and Phoebe Chillax.\r\n\r\nThese storytellers were miscounting the days since game start, and so were sometimes incorrectly sending a several raids in the 5-10 day range, making this crucial part of the early game far too hard.\r\n\r\nThis update is tiny (two lines of code) so it shouldn't affect compatibility with saves or mods.\r\n\r\nHowever, because it will shift the storyteller's timer, it may cause some players to get a string of raids in a row, or a long peaceful period. This will only happen once.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It does seem it may be possible for this to break mod compatibility, maybe. It's possible that even the tiniest change to code can cause the binary APIs to fail to link up. I'm very sorry if you're affected by this and am hoping to avoid breaking releases for a while while we work on a large Alpha 16 update. This is a somewhat-unavoidable challenge that comes with opening the entire codebase to modders (instead of keeping their code in a walled kiddy garden)",
