  "description": "Description: Prezi is a comprehensive and practical software solution whose main purpose is to help users create stunning presentations effortlessly. The application enables you to store your customized presentations both locally and online into your account by uploading them and accessing them remotely whenever you want.\n\nBefore actually using the application, you need to choose the template you like most, then insert images, shapes, symbols, YouTube videos and specific files so you can personalize the presentation as you prefer. The differences between Prezi and other applications that help you to create interesting presentations is that you can export your work to PDF format or as a portable app and run the presentation without the need of Prezi installed.By using Prezi you have the possibility to add object animations, change the order between slides and modify the theme as you wish.\nAlso, you are able to create and store prezis securely on your computer, USB drive or local network so you can easily share them with your friends and colleagues.\nPrezi allows you to communicate design ideas, strategies and concepts in a highly engaging and dynamic way because it brings motion and flexibility to the art of the presentation.\nMoreover, because of its complexity and features that Prezi comes with, it can be used in schools and in companies as well. Teachers have the task of conveying complex ideas in a short amount of time, but here Prezi comes in handy. You have the possibility to create connections between various topics, without losing the main idea and your studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ focus.\nWith the help of Prezi, your presentations can be as interesting as your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cause and enable you to present new ideas in an intuitive and interactive environment.\n\nNote :- This torrent was originally uploaded to Kickass.
