Author Gregg Ward draws on 25 years of leadership consulting, coaching and training experience to reveal the secret to great results: respect. In this true-to-life business fable, he shares the story of Des Hogan, a CEO who discovers that disrespectful behavior on the part of his leadership team is eating away at his company's morale, productivity, and profits. At a loss for a solution, he meets Graceâ€”a straight-shooting, self-described &quot;little old lady&quot; in the maintenance department. With her no-nonsense advice, he sets out to revamp the culture and turn his company around; but first, he has to turn inward and realize that his own behavior sets the tone for the company at every level. This enlightening, engaging and honest story will help you recognize and analyze your own behaviors and interactions, and show you how to create a winning culture based on leading with respect","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c48a7c559dfeca5cc81dc8dff8307faee0df6906","amp;dn":"The+Respectful+Leader+%282016%29+%28EPUB%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c48a7c559dfeca5cc81dc8dff8307faee0df6906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,138,124,85,157,254,202,92,200,29,200,223,248,48,127,174,224,223,105,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
