  "description": "We Are Harlot, often shortened to just Harlot, is a rock band and supergroup organised by singer Danny Worsnop formerly of Asking Alexandria and guitarist Jeff George formerly of Sebastian Bach.\n\n The lineup also includes bassist Brian Weaver from Silvertide and drummer Bruno Agra formerly of Revolution Renaissance. Formed in 2011, they released their first single titled &quot;Denial&quot; in 2014 and intend to release their debut album of the same name on March 30 2015.\n\nIn early January 2015 the band issued a statement via Rocksound Magazine that they will be releasing their debut album in March that same year.\n\n The band officially announced their self-titled debut album in January after releasing their second single, Dancing On Nails, and made it available to pre-order for March 31.\n\n Worsnop also announced his departure from Asking Alexandria, stating that he wanted to focus on this band more and also felt that Asking Alexandria would do better without him, also admitting that he no longer wanted to create heavy music anymore.\n\n The band has been announced to perform at South Florida's 'Fort Rock' festival and North Florida's 'Rockville' festival in April 2015, and have been set to perform at Rock on the Range for the second time along with a new festival named 'Northern Invasion' based in Somerset, both of which take place in May.\n\n They also intend to perform at both Download Festival, which will serve as their debut performance in the UK, and at Sonisphere Festival in Milan, Italy, which will serve as their debut performance in Italy in June.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by We Are Harlot.\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Dancing On Nails&quot;   \t        2:40\n2. \t&quot;Dirty Little Thing&quot;    \t3:10\n3. \t&quot;Someday&quot;   \t                4:06\n4. \t&quot;Denial&quot;   \t                4:08\n5. \t&quot;Easier To Leave&quot;         \t3:21\n6. \t&quot;One More Night&quot;   \t        3:21\n7. \t&quot;Never Turn Back&quot;   \t        3:31\n8. \t&quot;The One&quot;   \t                3:23\n9. \t&quot;Love For the Night&quot;    \t2:58\n10. \t&quot;Flying Too Close To the Sun&quot;   3:20\n11. \t&quot;I Tried&quot;   \t                3:40\n\nPersonnel\n\nWe Are Harlot\n\n    Bruno Agra - drums\n    Jeff George - guitars\n    Brian Weaver - bass guitar\n    Danny Worsnop - lead vocals\n\nProduction\n\n    Kato Khandwala - producer\n    Scott Stevens - producer\n\n\n\n                Tour Dates\n \t\n\nDate \tVenue \tLocation \t  \tTickets \t  \t \n\n  \t\n        Apr 02 \tJoe's Grotto \tPhoenix, AZ \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\t\n  \t\n        Apr 03 \tStrummers \tFresno, CA \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tSha\n  \t\n        Apr 07 \tKnitting Factory \tReno, NV \t  \tTickets \te\n  \t\n        Apr 09 \tThe Palomino \tSpokane, WA \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \t\n        Apr 11 \tKnitting Factory \tBoise, ID \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tApr 24 \tVinyl Music Hall \tPensacola, FL \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tApr 25 \tJet Blue Park \tFort Myers, FL \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \t\n        Apr 26 \tMetropolitan Park \tJacksonville, FL \t  \t  \tRSVP\t\nShare\n  \tApr 28 \tHuntington \tNew York, NY \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tApr 29 \tStarland Ballroom \tSayreville, NJ \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tApr 30 \tHard Times \tFredericksburg, VA \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 01 \tFarm Bureau Live \tVirginia Beach, VA \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 02 \tCharlotte Motor Speedway \tConcord, NC \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 03 \tThe International \tKnoxville, TN \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 04 \tOttobar \tBaltimore, MD \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 06 \tMercy Lounge \tNashville, TN \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 07 \tDistrict \tRockford, IL \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 08 \tCourt Avenue Bridge \tDes Moines, IA \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 09 \tSomerset Park \tSomerset, WI \t  \t  \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 11 \tAltar Bar \tPittsburgh, PA \t  \tTickets \tRSVP\tShare\n  \tMay 12 \tChameleon Club\n\nGo out and support the band ,buy the merch from the vendors at the show, that money goes into the bands pockets ,where it belongs",
