Some of you may have heard of or played the first version, which was\ncrawling with bugs, but I assure you, v2 is a lot more stable. The most important thing is that you can, unlike in\nthe first version, actually finish the game by accomplishing all the missions. There still are a few bugs left,\nbugs that crash the game, but they can be easily avoided (each bug only needs avoiding once). I'll get to that later.\n\n*I have also made a trailer for the game. Actually, it's more like a presentation. You can download the movie from\nthe link written at the end of the English section. If you've downloaded the game, you already have the movie.\nIt's called &quot;GTAtitles&quot; and it's located in the folder called &quot;movies&quot;.\n\nNow, about those bugs. If you don't plan on accomplishing missions, you can skip the list.\nHere's the list of missions with bugs and how you're supposed to avoid them.\n\n1. &quot;Cesar Vialpando&quot;\nAt the end of the mission you will spawn inside the car. Not sitting down. You can't get out no matter\nhow hard you try. What you need to do is simply type &quot;rocketman&quot; (without the quotes) and fly out of the car.\n\n2. &quot;OG Loc&quot;\nAfter you pick up OG Loc from prison, you'll go with him to kill some guy named Freddy. When you get to his house,\nFreddy is going to make a run for it on his bike. You and OG Loc will get on another bike and start chasing him.\nWhile you're chasing him, do not shoot at him! If he dies during the chase, the game will crash. Instead, follow him\nuntil he stops. Then you can kill him.\n\n3. &quot;Los Sepulcros&quot;\nAfter you get in the car, do not leave Grove Street by going forward (under the bridge)! Instead, go through the\nalleyway on the left, around CJ's house, and turn right. If you did this right, you should be passing by Denise's house.\n\n4. &quot;Mike Toreno&quot;\nAfter you save Toreno, when you exit the airport and stop in the red circle, it disappears. The game still says you're\nsupposed to be in that spot, and even though you are, the game doesn't see it that way. What you have to do is get\nout of the car, walk away from it, so as Toreno and T-Bone follow you. Then quickly run back to the car and leave them\nbehind. The game will then say you have to go back for them. When you do, they will get back in the car and the game\nwill tell you where to go next. This bug was also in the original version of San Andreas, so it's not my fault.\n\nAnd there you have it. Do everything like I told you and you shouldn't have any problems.\nBut before you play the game, there's a bit more you should know.\n\n1. You will sometimes find yourself waiting for the game to load a bit more than you would have expected. Don't worry,\nit hasn't frozen. As long as the red light on your PC is lit, just give it some time. Trust me, it will work.\n\n2. Not all cars can be modified in tuning shops. You can try with whichever car you want, but at your own risk.\nSometimes the game will crash, and sometimes the cars will look totally awkward.\n\n3. I have included several hi-res maps which I'm sure some of you will find very useful. They're located in the folder called\n&quot;Hi-res maps&quot;.\n\n4. If you play this game, you absolutely MUST enjoy it! If you don't, the game will crash.\n\nAll that being said, I hope you enjoy the game!\n\nShould you ever need help with any GTA game, just send an e-mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1a7d6e7b457b696973696e7b74797f5a637b72757534797577&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; including your\nquestion/s or a detailed description of your problem and I'll do my best to try and help you.\n\nThanks to all the authors of the mods I've used, without whom none of this would have been possible.\n\n*The presentation can be downloaded here:\nYou might need to install a toolbar. Don't worry, it's spyware/adware free.\nYou can also see it on YouTube and Metacafe, but the quality is not as great.\n\nP.S. My next project will be Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Old Skool. It will probably be released by March 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e65e2af037a92d4ac5f64e873194c18af545c6c2","amp;dn":"GTA+San+Andreas+Real+v2+%5Bovisebdan%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e65e2af037a92d4ac5f64e873194c18af545c6c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,94,42,240,55,169,45,74,197,246,78,135,49,148,193,138,245,69,198,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
