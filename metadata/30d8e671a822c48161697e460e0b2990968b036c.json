  "description": "Herbs and Nutrients for Neurologic Disorders - Treatment Strategies for Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis, Migraine and Seizures (2016) (Epub) Gooner \r\n\r\nPublisher: Healing Arts Press; 2 edition (28 July 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1620555530\r\nISBN-13: 978-1620555538\r\n\r\nNumerous medical journals have published studies supporting the use of herbs and nutrients in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Yet in practice most neurologists rarely include them as part of their protocols. In this practical guide, Sidney Kurn, M.D., and Sheryl Shook, Ph.D., explain how to safely and easily incorporate herbs, antioxidants, and nutritional supplements into the standard conventional treatments for 6 common neurologic disorders: Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinsonâ€™s, multiple sclerosis, stroke, migraine, and seizures.\r\n\r\nFor each condition, the authors provide detailed strategies supported by scientific evidence and years of successful clinical practice. They examine the biochemical role of each recommended herb, nutrient, or antioxidant and discuss potential side effects, counter-indications, and proper dosages to reduce symptoms, slow disease progression, andâ€”in the case of stroke, migraine, and seizuresâ€”lessen the chances of recurrence. \r\nIntegrating neuroscience, biochemistry, herbalism, and decades of clinical experience, the authors lay the scientific foundation for a holistic, naturopathic approach to neurologic disorders and a way to enhance the quality of life for those suffering from these conditions",
