The band was born in Akron, Ohio in 2001.\n\nCareer\nEarly history and The Big Come Up (2001ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“02):\nThe Black Keys formed in 2001 and were active in the underground scene of Akron, Ohio. The band released their debut album, The Big Come Up, in early 2002. The album was very successful for a new independent rock band. Along with their second album Thickfreakness, it was recorded entirely in drummer Patrick Carney's basement on an 8-track tape recorder from the early 1980s. The album spawned two singles released as an extended play, Leavin' Trunk and She Said, She Said which are both cover songs. &quot;Leavin' Trunk&quot; is a traditional blues standard and &quot;She Said, She Said&quot; is originally by The Beatles. &quot;I'll Be Your Man&quot; would later be used as the theme for the HBO series Hung. &quot;Breaks&quot; was featured in the 2008 film &quot;RocknRolla&quot;.\n\nThickfreakness era (2003):\nThe band released Thickfreakness in April, 2003 which along with The Big Come Up was recorded in Carney's basement. The album was favored by critics and three singles were released from the album; Set You Free, Hard Row and a cover of Have Love, Will Travel. Set You Free was featured on the soundtrack for School of Rock, as well as 2009 comedy I Love You, Man.\n\nThe band released a split-EP with The Six Parts Seven on September 16, 2003, titled The Six Parts Seven/The Black Keys EP and featured one song by The Six Parts Seven and three songs by The Black Keys.\n\nRubber Factory and first live album (2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“05):\nRubber Factory, the band's third album was released in 2004. During Thickfreakness and Rubber Factory, the band gained reception and popularity, boosting their career. Rubber Factory was recorded in an abandoned factory in early 2004. The factory was located in Akron, but, according to Carney was finally torn down in early 2010. The album featured singles 10 A.M. Automatic, and 'Til I Get My Way and Girl Is On My Mind, released as an EP. &quot;When the Lights Go Out&quot; was used in trailers for the film Black Snake Moan. Additionally, &quot;10 A.M.

Kimbrough was a bluesman and the founder of Fat Possum Records , whom the band had previously covered on The Big Come Up. The EP was released on May 2, 2006. Four days later The Black Keys released their second live album, Live in Austin, TX, also known as Thickfreakness in Austin. It was recorded October 24, 2003 and released May 6, 2006. Soon after, they released their fourth album Magic Potion, which was their first album on Nonesuch Records. The album featured three singles; You're the One, Your Touch and Just Got To Be. The latter was featured on the soundtrack to the video game, NHL 08. Your Touch was featured on the 2009 film Zombieland as well as the HBO series Eastbound and Down. The Black Keys recorded a cover of &quot;The Wicked Messenger&quot; for the soundtrack of I'm Not There and have recorded &quot;If You Ever Slip&quot;, a song written by Jesse Harris for The Hottest State soundtrack.\n\nAttack &amp; Release (2008)\nAttack &amp; Release, the band's fifth album, was produced by Danger Mouse and released on April 1, 2008, having leaked onto the internet by March 4.
