  "description": "The Martian is the first published novel by American novelist Andy Weir.\n\nAfter a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, astronaut Mark Watney finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aliveÃ¢â‚¬â€and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old &quot;human error&quot; are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skillsÃ¢â‚¬â€and a relentless, dogged refusal to quitÃ¢â‚¬â€he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?\n",
