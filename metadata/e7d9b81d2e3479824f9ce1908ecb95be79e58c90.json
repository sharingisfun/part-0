  "description": "George Raymond Richard Martin (born September 20, 1948), sometimes referred to as GRRM, is an American author of fantasy, horror, and science fiction, a screenwriter, and a television producer. He is best known for A Song of Ice and Fire, his international bestselling series of epic fantasy novels that HBO adapted for their dramatic series Game of Thrones, in which he also serves as co-executive producer and screenwriter of one episode per season. Martin was selected by Time Magazine as one of the &quot;2011 Time 100&quot;, a list of the &quot;most influential people in the world&quot;.\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels which George R. R. Martin began in 1991 and published the first volume, A Game of Thrones, in 1996. Martin gradually extended the originally planned trilogy into seven volumes. The fifth installment, A Dance with Dragons, took Martin five years to write before it was published in 2011. The sixth book, The Winds of Winter, is currently being written.\n\nThe five book set comprises of the following novels :\n\n1. A GAME OF THRONES\n2. A CLASH OF KINGS\n3. A STORM OF SWORDS\n4. A FEAST OF CROWS\n5. A DANCE WITH DRAGONS\n\nThough initially published without great fanfare, the books in the series have now sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and have been translated into more than 20 languages. The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller lists upon their releases. Among the many derived works are three prequel novellas, the HBO TV series Game of Thrones, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.",
