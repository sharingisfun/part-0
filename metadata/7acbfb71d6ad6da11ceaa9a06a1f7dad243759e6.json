  "description": "Kenai, a man who resents bears after a fight with one kills his older brother, is turned into a bear so he can see life from a different perspective. He is visited by the spirit of his older brother, and is told that, if he wishes to be changed back into a human, he must travel to the place where the lights touch the Earth, in other words, the Northern Lights. Fueled by hope, Kenai sets off on his long journey, and, along the way, encounters a younger bear, Koda, who is a chatterbox and a fun-loving spirit; Koda is trying to find his way back to his home, the Salmon Run, which, coincidentally, is right next to where the lights touch the Earth. Koda and Kenai team up, but are hunted by Kenais other brother, Denahi, who fears that the a bear has killed Kenai as well. Along the way, the two bears meet other friends, including too moose, some rams, and some mammoths, with who they hitch a rideÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328880/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328880/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Animation | Adventure | Family | Fantasy\niMDB Rating: 6,6/10 from 33 291 users\nDirectors: Aaron Blaise, Robert Walker\nCast: Joaquin Phoenix, Jeremy Suarez and Rick Moranis\n\nLength: 01:25:04\nVideo info: H264, 920 kbps, 1000 fps\nAudio info: AAC , 159 kbps , 48000 Hz\n\nSource Used: Brother Bear 2003 1080p BluRay X264-AMIABLE",
