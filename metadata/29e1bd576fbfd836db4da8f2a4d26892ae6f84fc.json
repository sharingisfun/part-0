Ege Bamyasi is basically highlight after highlight of glorious music.\nEge BamyasÃ„Â± has received considerable critical acclaim since its release. Pitchfork Media featured the record at #19 on its &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot;. British music weekly Melody Maker wrote: &quot;Can are without doubt the most talented and most consistent experimental rock band in Europe, England included.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Krautrock is a German avant-garde / experimental rock movement that emerged at the end of the 1960's. The term krautrock was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as New Musical Express and Melody Maker), where &quot;krautrock&quot; found an early and enthusiastic underground following. \nJulian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says &quot;Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon,&quot; based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew.  The term is also a problematic category due to the considerable differences between the artists so labelled.\nKey artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.\n\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e1bd576fbfd836db4da8f2a4d26892ae6f84fc","amp;dn":"CAN+-+Ege+Bamyasi+1972+%2F+2004+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e1bd576fbfd836db4da8f2a4d26892ae6f84fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,225,189,87,111,191,216,54,219,77,168,242,164,210,104,146,174,111,132,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
