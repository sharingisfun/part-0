  "description": "Issues Resolved in Pro Tools 10.3.2\n* Automation breakpoints are no longer added unnecessarily when editing clips with Automation Follows Edit turned on. (PTSW-173028)\n* Automation overlaying audio that is then processed using the Strip Silence command is kept intact. (PTSW-170804)\n* Very large files exported to Interplay will not be quarantined. (PTSW-154522)\n* Web Services hostname / IP address is now remembered between Send to Playback exports. (PTSW-172334)\n* The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Capture SelectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ function in Beat Detective now captures the correct end time based on the selected note resolution instead of actual transient location. (PTSW-172978)\n\nIssues Resolved in Pro Tools 10.3.1\n* Unwanted data is no longer appended to the end of record passes under certain conditions. (PTSW-170032)\n* On Pro Tools HDX systems, 176.4/192kHz sessions are now free of unwanted noise in some specific mixer configurations. (PTSW-166529)\n* When zoomed into the sample level, waveforms whose clip start is off-screen now draw accurately (instead of one sample late). (PTSW-162497)\n* Clicking the Automation Follows Edit button now correctly causes the current selection to update to reflect the new state of the button. (PTSW-170044)\n* Automation breakpoints outside of a pasted selection area that match the edge values of the pasted automation (redundant breakpoints) are no longer modified when pasting. (PTSW-171725)\n* AudioSuite operations using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whole FileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ parameter no longer result in unwanted changes to audio data or cause Pro Tools to quit unexpectedly. (PTSW-170456, PTSW-170920)\n* In Dynamic Transport mode with Link Timeline and Edit Selection enabled, the playhead no longer moves to beginning of the selection.
