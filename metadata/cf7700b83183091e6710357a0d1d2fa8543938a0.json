As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss PeregrineÃ¢Â€â„¢s Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehowâ€”impossible though it seemsâ€”they may still be alive.\r\n\r\n A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss PeregrineÃ¢Â€â„¢s Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows",
