Drifting through Europe after fleeing political violence in India that killed the family restaurant business and their mother, the Kadams arrive in France. Once there, a chance auto accident and the kindness of a young woman, Marguerite, in the village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val inspires Papa Kadam to set up a Indian restaurant there. Unfortunately, this puts the Kadams in direct competition with the snobbish Madame Mallory's acclaimed haute cuisine establishment across the street where Marguerite also works as a sous-chef. The resulting rivalry eventually escalates in personal intensity until it goes too far. In response, there is a bridging of sides initiated by Hassan, Marguerite and Madame Mallory herself, both professional and personal, that encourages an understanding that will change both sides forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:386d6c7733aec1e5a13ceae42a20a6b4b728b3dc","amp;dn":"The+Hundred-Foot+Journey+%282014%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"386d6c7733aec1e5a13ceae42a20a6b4b728b3dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,109,108,119,51,174,193,229,161,60,234,228,42,32,166,180,183,40,179,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
