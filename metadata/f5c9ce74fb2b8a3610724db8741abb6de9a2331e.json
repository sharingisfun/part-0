It begins when Ryan was attending the London School of Economics; and 9/11 happened. He would then enlist in the Marines and would go to Afghanistan. The chopper he was on would get shot down and he would suffer severe injuries that would require intense rehab. While there, he grabs the attention of a man named Harper, who works for the CIA and would like him to finish his studies and get a job on Wall Street so he can find out of any terrorist plot through their finances. A few years later, Ryan finds anomalies in the accounts of a Russian named Cherevin. Jack thinks he should go to Russia to find out what's going on. Jack was told not to tell anyone who he is and that includes his girl friend Cathy. But she catches Jack in some lies which makes her doubt him. Jack goes to Russia and Cherevin assigns him someone to take care of him. But when they're alone the man tries to kill Jack. So Jack kills him. Obvious Cherevin is hiding something so Jack goes to meet him, and he says he will bring his fiance along. But Cathy shows up and Jack has to tell her the truth. Harper says Cathy has to go with Jack when she meets Cherevin. Jack doesn't want her to but Cathy says she's going. So the action begins that leads to the climax...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536da20156a54.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536da20156a54.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536da201745c1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536da201745c1.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536da20188544.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536da20188544.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5c9ce74fb2b8a3610724db8741abb6de9a2331e","amp;dn":"Jack+Ryan+Shadow+Recruit+%282014%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5c9ce74fb2b8a3610724db8741abb6de9a2331e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,201,206,116,251,43,138,54,16,114,77,184,116,26,187,109,233,162,51,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
