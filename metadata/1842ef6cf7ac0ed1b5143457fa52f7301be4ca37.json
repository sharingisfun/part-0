Comprehensive coverage of Java and programming make this a useful reference for beginning programmers and IT professionals.\n\n\n\nDaniel Liang teaches concepts of problem-solving and object-oriented programming using a fundamentals-first approach. Beginning programmers learn critical problem-solving techniques then move on to grasp the key concepts of object-oriented, GUI programming, advanced GUI and Web programming using Java.\n\n\n\nMyProgrammingLab for Introduction to Java Programming is a total learning package. MyProgrammingLab is an online homework, tutorial, and assessment program that truly engages students in learning. It helps students better prepare for class, quizzes, and examsÃ¢â‚¬â€œresulting in better performance in the courseÃ¢â‚¬â€œand provides educators a dynamic set of tools for gauging individual and class progress.\n\n\n\nTeaching and Learning Experience\n\nTo provide a better teaching and learning experience, for both instructors and students, this program offers:\n\nPersonalized Learning: Through the power of practice and immediate personalized feedback, MyProgrammingLab helps students fully grasp the logic, semantics, and syntax of programming.\nFundamentals-First Approach: Basic programming concepts are introduced on control statements, loops, functions, and arrays before object-oriented programming is discussed.\nProblem-Driven Motivation: The examples and exercises throughout the book emphasize problem solving and foster the concept of developing reusable components and using them to create practical projects.\nA Superior Pedagogical Design that Fosters Student Interest: Key concepts are reinforced with objectives lists, introduction and chapter overviews, easy-to-follow examples, chapter summaries, review questions, programming exercises, and interactive self-tests.\nThe Most Extensive Instructor and Student Support Package Available: The author maintains a website at www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro10e that includes multiple interactive resources.\n\nNote: This is the standalone book, if you want the book/access code order the ISBN below:\n\n\n\n0133813460 / 9780133813463 Intro to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version &amp; MyProgrammingLab with Pearson eText -- Access Card Package\n\nPackage consists of\n\n0133761312 / 9780133761313 Intro to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version\n\n0133762513 / 9780133762518 MyProgrammingLab with Pearson eText -- Access Card -- for Intro to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version, 10/e\n\n\n\nMyProgrammingLab is not a self-paced technology and should only be purchased when required by an instructor.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDr. Liang earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Okalahoma in 1991, and an MS and BS in Computer Science from Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in 1986 and 1983. Prior to joining Armstrong, he was an associate professor in computer science at Purdue University in Fort Wayne, where he twice received the Excellence in Research award.\n\nDr. Liang was trained in theoretical computer science. He was active in graph algorithms from 1990 to 1995 and published more than ten papers in several established journals such as SIAM Journal on Computing, Discrete Applied Mathematics, Acta Informatics, and Information Processing Letters. Since 1996, he has devoted to writing texts and published more than thirty books with Prentice Hall. His popular computer science texts are widely adopted in the world.\n\nDr. Liang was elected a Java Champion in 2005 by Sun Microsystems. He has given lectures on Java internationally.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia",
