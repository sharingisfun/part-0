  "description": "[b]Adobe After Effects CC 2015 13.7.1 Multilingual[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]https://dump.bz/storage-1/0715/TBIzHj8L4WeOX2d9hGV6U35OxU7xUAAN.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nWhat's new in Adobe After Effects CC 2015:\r\n\r\nFind the perfect image or graphic for your project\r\nSave time finding, licensing and managing royalty-free stock images and graphics now that After Effects CC integrates with the new Adobe Stock service. Once you save an image to your Creative Cloud Libraries, itâ€™s immediately available for use in your compositions and other creative projects.\r\n\r\nYour assets, available anywhere\r\nAccess and share important creative assets â€” like Looks and graphics â€” via Creative Cloud Libraries that are available in After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop and Illustrator; mobile apps like Shape; and services like Adobe Stock.\r\n\r\nPreview without interruptions\r\nAdjust a compositionâ€™s properties and even resize panels without interrupting playback. Uninterrupted preview keeps up with your creativity.\r\n\r\nTrack faces with greater accuracy\r\nThe Face Tracker makes it easy to apply effects to select areas of faces. Use simple tracking to color correct or blur a face; track specific points to change eye color or mouth movements; or track measurements, such as how wide an eye is open. You can even export data to Adobe Character Animator.\r\n\r\nEasily animate 2D characters\r\nGive life to characters you create in Illustrator or Photoshop by acting out their movements in front of a webcam. Adobe Character Animator tracks your facial movements, lets you record dialogue or a voice performance and enables you to trigger actions with your keyboard.\r\n\r\nPreview the way that works best for you\r\nPreview compositions, layers and footage based on your experience and preferences. Choose intuitive default behaviors, create customized previews for different triggers or revert to legacy preview behaviors with a few clicks.\r\n\r\nAdapt the UI to your preferences\r\nNavigate panels faster thanks to streamlined panel groups. Adjust the brightness of interactive controls to get the contrast just right.\r\n\r\nOptimize the UI for touch\r\nIn the first steps toward a more touch-friendly compositing environment, After Effects makes it easier to navigate between panels in a group by letting you choose and activate panels with touch-optimized controls.\r\n\r\nAnd so much more\r\nAlso includes: Enhancements that save time when working with expressions, the ability to import JPEG 2000 files and more.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n- Intel Core2 Duo or AMD Phenom II processor with 64-bit support\r\n- Microsoft Windows 7 with Service Pack 1, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1\r\n- 4GB of RAM (8GB recommended)\r\n- 5GB of available hard-disk space; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable fl ash storage devices)\r\n- Additional disk space for disk cache (10GB recommended)\r\n- 1280x1080 display\r\n- OpenGL 2.0â€“capable system\r\n- QuickTime 7.6.6 soft ware required for QuickTime features\r\n- Optional: Adobe-certifi ed GPU card for GPU-accelerated ray-traced 3D renderer\r\n- Internet connection and registration are necessary for required soft ware activation, validation of subscriptions, and access to online services.*[/b]",
