  "description": "Accelerate your high-res workflow\n\nMore content today is shot with high-res cameras, but the majority of programming is still HD. With the new FrameFlex tools, you can immediately start working in HD directly from high-res sources and maintain full creative control of the image reframing and keyframing, from beginning to end. In addition, 1D/3D Look Up Tables (LUTs) and Color Decision Lists (CDLs) make it easy to perform real-time RAW and LogC to Rec. 709 color space conversions.\n\nAutomate your media management\n\nGain more time for creativity with new features that accelerate and simplify file-based workflows. With Dynamic Media Folders, noncreative media tasks such as transcoding, copying, and consolidating can be automated in the background, without disrupting your editorial flow. Plus, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get peace of mind as Media Composer now fully manages AMA-linked media as reliably as it does with native Avid media.\n\nEdit and collaborate remotely in real time\n\nEdit, share, tag, track, and sync media and projects with everyone on your editing teamÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter where you are in the world. Media Composer enables you to connect to Interplay | Production systems through Media Composer | Cloud (formerly Interplay Sphere), making remote cloud-based collaboration easy and cost-effective. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, you can edit just as efficiently as you would if you were all at the home facility, using the same tools and workflows you know and trust.\n\nGain total audio control\n\nForget wasting time mixing down audio levels by trial and error. With the new Master Audio Fader, you can insert RTAS plug-ins to tweak tones and optimize the overall program loudness, making broadcast regulation adherence quick and easy. You can also now make audio adjustments to any clip directly in the timeline independently of any track-based automation with the Clip Gain control.\n\nStreamline the video workflow with Pro Tools users\n\nVideo Satellite is now included with Media Composer, enabling audio editors and mixers to play Avid HD and SD video sequences directly in sync with their Pro Tools session, while maintaining full system power. In addition, Pro Tools | Software now includes the Avid Video Engine, enabling Pro Tools sound editors and mixers to play HD video of the latest Media Composer cuts directly in the Pro Tools timeline.\n\nExpand your creativity with options\n\nEdit with the exact tools you need by simply adding options for the workflows you want. Add advanced and secondary color correction tools, mastering tools, and the Boris Continuum Complete Lite effects pack with the Media Composer | Symphony Option for online editing. Integrate Media Composer into iNEWS and ENPS workflows with the Media Composer | NewsCutter Option for news editing. And capture, monitor, and output video with a hardware-accelerated Media Composer | Nitris DX or Media Composer | Mojo DX video I/O interface. View these and more on the.\n\nAnd moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n*Create cut lists and EDLs from within Media Composer\n*Do multicam editing in stereoscopic 3D\n*Get 9-way real-time multicam support for Long GOP (XDCAM) media\n*Select multiple clips in the timeline without the filler\n*Edit without interruption with new audio waveform caching\n*View location sound metadata from Broadcast Wave files with support for iXML\n*Deliver finished sequences to a standardized AS-11 (AMWA) MXF OP1a file\n*Work with Alpha channel media using the new AMA QuickTime with Alpha plug-in\n*Edit easier with new AMA enhancements (see how): ?Find what you need faster with the new AMA navigation window\n-Consolidate or transcode only AMA clips in your sequence\n-Relink to specified video and audio tracks in your timeline\n-Speed through tasks with drag-and-drop support\n\nWhat's new in Media Composer 8\n\nConfigure it your way - Get great flexibility with options that open up more creative opportunities.\n\nPay for only what you need - With a much lower cost of entry, the industry's top editing tool is easily within reach.\n\nAccelerate high-res workflows - Acquire high-resolution media and deliver in HD with full creative control of reframing.\n\nAutomate media management - Spend more time being creative by automating media tasks in the background.\n\nGain total audio control - Master the overall audio mix using RTAS plug-ins on the Master Audio Fader.\n\nMinimum System requirements\n\nImportant: Avid dedicates a significant amount of engineering resources and time to test and qualify specific platform configurations.
