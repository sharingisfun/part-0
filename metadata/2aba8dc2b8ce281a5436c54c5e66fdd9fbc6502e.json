  "description": "What Is Vector Magic?\n\nVector Magic, Inc. provides vectorization software and services.\n\nVector Magic's flagship service is the online auto tracer available on this website. It converts bitmap (aka raster) images to vector images through an easy-to-use web interface - just upload your image and it will guide you through the process.\n\nThe conversion process as such is called tracing or vectorization and is something that has historically been done mostly by hand. An automated tool like the Vector Magic web service can make this otherwise tedious task quick and painless.\n\nWe have tried to make the site and service as easy to use as possible, with a distinct and clear user-interface, while imposing a minimum of fuss. All that is required is a reasonably modern browser, Flash Player and an image you'd like to vectorize. ",
