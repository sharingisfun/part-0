I think both 'The Living Infinite' and our new album sums up our career very well, both musically and lyrically. There's a certain existential feel running through those albums and especially 'The Ride Majestic', brings up the darker existential aspects. As pretentious as it may sound, I also feel that we've left certain things behind and have entered a new era, where we let us be driven by spontaneity and emotion.&quot;\n\nAsked if there are any tracks that stand out to him as being deeply important on a personal level, Strid said: &quot;I think they all gradually become more important with age. However, some of the early more primal teenage angst oriented lyrics are harder to relate to today. One of the best lyrics I've ever written comes from the new album, 'Death In General', that captures the feeling of the very last moments with somebody close, who's on their death bed. Father and son, watching the world go down is from a very realistic dream that I had about the last moments on earth with my dad and the realization of the end.&quot;\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
