  "description": "\nPAUL AUSTER (b. 1947) is an American author and director whose writing blends absurdism, existentialism, crime fiction, and the search for identity and personal meaning.\n\nFollowing his acclaimed debut work, the memoir THE INVENTION OF SOLITUDE (1982), Auster gained renown for a series of three loosely connected detective stories published collectively as THE NEW YORK TRILOGY (1987).  These books are not conventional detective stories organized around a mystery and a series of clues.  Rather, he uses the detective form to address existential issues and questions of identity, space, language, and literature, creating his own distinctively postmodern (and critique of postmodernist) form in the process.\n\nMany of Auster's later publications concentrate heavily on the role of coincidence and random events, or increasingly, the relationships between people and their peers and environment (THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS [2002], MOON PALACE [1989]).  Auster's heroes often find themselves obliged to work as part of someone else's inscrutable and larger-than-life schemes.  Auster's more recent works, ORACLE NIGHT (2003), THE BROOKLYN FOLLIES (2005), and the novella TRAVELS IN THE SCRIPTORIUM (2006), have also met critical acclaim.\n\nIn addition to 12 novels, this collection also includes 3 memoirs -- THE INVENTION OF SOLITUDE (1982); WINTER JOURNAL (2012); and REPORT FROM THE INTERIOR (2013) -- along with Auster's COLLECTED PROSE (2003) and an exchange of letters with J. M. Coetzee.\n\n\nAll the following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS (Faber &amp; Faber, 2002)\n\n* THE BROOKLYN FOLLIES (Faber &amp; Faber, 2005)\n\n* COLLECTED PROSE (Faber &amp; Faber, 2003)\n\n* HERE AND NOW: Letters, 2008-2011 [with J. M. Coetzee] (Penguin, 2013)\n\n* THE INVENTION OF SOLITUDE (Penguin, 2007).  With an Introduction by Pascal Bruckner.\n\n* INVISIBLE (Henry Holt, 2009)\n\n* MAN IN THE DARK (Henry Holt, 2008)\n\n* MOON PALACE (Penguin, 1989)\n\n* THE NEW YORK TRILOGY (Penguin, 2006).

Comprising &quot;City of Glass&quot; (1985); &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1986); and &quot;The Locked Room&quot; (1986).\n\n* ORACLE NIGHT (Faber &amp; Faber, 2004)\n\n* REPORT FROM THE INTERIOR (Henry Holt, 2013)\n\n* SUNSET PARK (Henry Holt, 2010)\n\n* TIMBUKTU (Henry Holt, 1999)\n\n* TRAVELS IN THE SCRIPTORIUM (Faber &amp; Faber, 2006)\n\n* WINTER JOURNAL (McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2012)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
