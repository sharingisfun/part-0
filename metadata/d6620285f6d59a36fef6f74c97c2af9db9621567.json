  "description": "Hey guys, here titan souls. This is the digital special edition of the game so it comes with the soundtrack, artbook and world map. Mac version coming soon. Hope you enjoy and please help seed.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢\n\n\nThe Titan Souls Digital Special Edition will include a digital artbook, world map, full original soundtrack, and desktop backgrounds. (Coming soon!)\n\nBetween our world and the world beyond lie the Titan Souls, the spiritual source and sum of all living things. Now scattered amongst the ruins and guarded by the idle titans charged with their care, a solitary hero armed with but a single arrow is once again assembling shards of the Titan Soul in a quest for truth and power.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Colossal Titans: Explore the ancient ruins of your forefathers and uncover extraordinary and unique titans, each with their own savage attacks and hidden weakness. Find and exploit their faults to slay the beasts and consume the primeval power that lies within them.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Simple Combat: Loose your solitary arrow at the monstrous titans and summon it back to your hand to unleash another forceful strike. Dash and run from the titanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attacks but do not fear death, as it is both inevitable and plentiful in Titan Souls.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Arcane Secrets: This realm is not without its secrets. Long forgotten titans are hidden in the shadows and prowling through the furthest corners of the land Ã¢â‚¬â€œ find them, destroy them, and take their souls for your own to discover the true extent of the power that resides here.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/titan_souls_digital_special_edition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/titan_souls_digital_special_edition&lt;/a&gt;",
