But when it comes to 3D features, however, it lacks. Now we know that you can pay a lot more to get 3D versatility in some of Autodeskâ€™s more premium products but for a lot of small businesses that already find LT to be an expensive option, we would love to see more basic 3D options available.\r\n- Bring back the Classic Workspace view â€“ If you are a long time user of AutoCAD LT, then youâ€™ll be bummed that the Classic Workspace view is no longer available in the 2016 perpetual version (those on the subscription plan still can switch to it). The new workspace interface is so dramatically different that if youâ€™re upgrading from an older version then youâ€™ll have to commit some time to learning it over again to become efficient with the software. While Autodesk cites their decision to remove the view as a â€œnatural evolution towards a modern and more efficient interfaceâ€, we would like to see the option return for those that want it.\r\n- Improve digital rights management and support â€“ Autodesk has a really poor licensing management setup and nearly no support available if you get stuck activating your new. In the 2016 release, we found a number of customers complaining that they could not activate their new licenses using their existing account Autodesk IDâ€™s when trying to install the software using â€œI already have an Autodesk accountâ€ installation option. The only workaround was to remove any trial versions of the software and reinstalling it under a newly created Autodesk ID. We hope that once the 2017 version rolls in that they will improve this setup process.\r\n\r\nAbout Autodesk:\r\nAutodesk helps people imagine, design and create a better world. Everyoneâ€”from design professionals, engineers and architects to digital artists, students and hobbyistsâ€”uses Autodesk software to unlock their creativity and solve important challenges.\r\n\r\nName: Autodesk AutoCAD\r\nVersion: (64bit) 2017\r\nHome: www.autodesk.com\r\nInterface: english\r\nOS: Windows 7even / 8 / 10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f241d7673c1723940fb854c24ade95b0a4b4064","amp;dn":"Autodesk+AutoCAD+2017+%28x64%29+%2B+Keygen+%5BSadeemPC%5D.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f241d7673c1723940fb854c24ade95b0a4b4064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,36,29,118,115,193,114,57,64,251,133,76,36,173,233,91,10,75,64,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
