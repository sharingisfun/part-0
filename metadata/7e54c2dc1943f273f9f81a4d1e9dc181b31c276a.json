  "description": "MP3 CBR 64k Joint Stereo.\nThis will work best with dedicated audiobook reader apps.\n\n\nThink Like a Freak: The Authors of Freakonomics Offer to Retrain Your Brain\n\nWritten by: Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner\nNarrated by: Stephen J. Dubner\nLength: 7 hrs and 5 mins \nFormat: Unabridged\nRelease Date:05-12-14\nProgram Type: Audiobook\n\nNow, with Think Like a Freak, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have written their most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and unconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems. The topics range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re from Nigeria.\n\nLevitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can, too. Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealing - and so much fun to read.\n\nSteven D. Levitt, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was awarded the John Bates Clark medal, given to the most influential American economist under the age of 40.\n\nStephen J. Dubner, an award-winning journalist and radio and TV personality, has worked for The New York Times and published three non-Freakonomics books.\n",
