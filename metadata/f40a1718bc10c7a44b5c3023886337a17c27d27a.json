  "description": "Mad Max (c) Warner Bros\n\nRelease Date : 14/09/2015\nProtection : Steam+Denuvo\nDiscs : 1\nGenre : Action-adventure\nCrack : 3DM.v3\nGame Version : 1.0.1.1\nLanguages : EN/FR/DE/IT/ES/PL/JP/PT-BR/RU\n\nIncluded DLC:\nMad Max: Ripper\nMad Max: Stampeedy Knokshok\nMad Max: ThirstCutter\n\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, which features terrains like canyons, caves, and deserts. The game's story is standalone, and was never planned as a tie-in of any of the films in the series. Inspirations for the game were taken from the Mad Max universe instead of the films. Players control Max Rockatansky as he progresses through the wasteland to seek his lost car, the Interceptor, and to build his ultimate car called the Magnum Opus. The game puts heavy emphasis on vehicular combat, in which around 60% of the game requires the player to drive their car to fight against enemies. Vehicular customization is also featured in the game.\n\n- Install\n- Copy crack\n- Play",
