  "description": "Shoppe Keeper wanted to run an adventurer retail establishment. Items sold include a variety of weapons, hats, apparel and potions. Applicants would need to set prices, maintain the shoppe and dabble in a bit of indoor gardening. Knowledge of lightning spells and a basic understanding of armed self-defense would be advantageous.\n\nFrom slaying dragons to everyday fetch quests, skilled adventurers need a one-stop shoppe to purchase essential wares. As the Shoppe Keeper, your business will become the busy hub for these epic warriors and mages",
