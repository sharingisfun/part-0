You will play\nas Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will follow a story,\nyou will not follow a story. You will have a choice, you will have no\nchoice. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction\nfollows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken,\nthen broken again. This world was not made for you to understand.\n\nBut as you explore, slowly, meaning begins to arise, the paradoxes\nmight start to make sense, perhaps you are powerful after all. The game\nis not here to fight you it is inviting you to dance.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1. Unpack the release\n2. Mount or burn image\n3. Install\n4.
