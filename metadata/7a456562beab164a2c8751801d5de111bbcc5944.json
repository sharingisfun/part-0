  "description": "== About the game:\nKerbal Space Program is a multi-genre game where players create their own space program.\n\nIn KSP, you must build space-worthy craft, capable of flying your crew out into space, without killing them. At your disposal is a collection of parts, which must be assembled to create a functional ship. Each part has its own function and will affect the way a ship flies (or doesn't). So strap yourself in, and get ready to try some Rocket Science!\n\nThe game has different game modes, you can play the Career Mode if you want to expand and manage your own Space Center, taking on missions and researching new technologies. Or you can play Sandbox mode if you're only interested in flying and discovering the Kerbal universe without restrictions. There is even a mid point between these two, Science mode.\n\n\n== Features:\nThe Vehicle Assembly Building and the Space Plane Hangar allows players to build spacecraft out of any imaginable combination of parts.\nFully-fledged, Physics-based Space Flight Simulation ensures everything will fly (and crash) as it should.\nTake your Kerbal crew out of the ship and do Extra Vehicular Activities.\nFly out to Moons and other Planets.\nProcedural Terrain delivers detailed terrain at a vast scale. The Kerbal Planet is 600km in radius!\nMod-enabled, allows players to create new content and modify the game.\nShip systems. Keep an eye out for engine temperatures and fuel levels, and try not to explode.\nBuild ships with multiple stages, and jettison parts away as they burn out.\nFull control over the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s setup allows for complex ships and advanced functionality.\nDock spacecraft together to build Space Stations, Massive Starships, or even surface bases on other worlds.\nManage your crewmembers, hire them, and send them out into space and make them into heroes.\nResearch and Develop new technologies to advance your Space Program.\nTake on Missions to attract interest in your Space Program.\nDiscover new worlds and expand the scientific knowledge of Kerbalkind.\nAnd a whole lot more!\n\n\n== Version:\nGOG update to v1.02 released on May 4, 2015\nYou need to have your base game already installed - GOG version \n\n\n== Version changes:\n v1.02 Bug Fixes and Tweaks: \n\nThermal: \n* Fixed ships potentially overheating when splashed down. \n\nParts \n* Small tweak to Mk16 parachute drag. \n\n\n== Instructions:\nIt's a GOG version, just launch setup\nSelect Update, install \nPlay - Enjoy - Seed - give me what I need\nSpeed!
