  "description": "Native Instruments Kontakt 5.3.0 WiN x86x64\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/kontakt-5/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/kontakt-5/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnprecedented power, a vast instrument library, effects and an advanced sampling framework plus deep editing capabilities: Connect with the industry standard software sampler!\n\nOver 1,000 instruments and 43+ GB of samples Featuring effects from SOLID MIX SERIES\n* 37 new filters, incl. resonance filters\n\nTHE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL SAMPLER\n\nOnce again, NATIVE INSTRUMENTS raises the bar with KONTAKT 5 -- the latest version of the industry-leading sampler. KONTAKT 5 takes a bold leap forward with 37 new filters, four new on-board studio effects, updated time-stretching, a new instrument bus system and more. As you will see from the new STUDIO DRUMMER, for example, it's a deep-rooted update to the KONTAKT platform, allowing us -- and you -- to create even better instruments and more powerful, expressive sounds.\n\n\nVAST 43 GB INSTRUMENT LIBRARY\n\nKONTAKT 5 includes a rich and diverse sound library with eight stunning Instrument Collections: Choir, Orchestral, World, Vintage, Band, Synth, Urban Beats and the new RETRO MACHINES MKII. In total, you get well over 1,000 different instruments, with over 43 GB of samples, all recorded and processed with meticulous attention to detail and quality.\n\nEvery instrument group has its own Performance View -- a clear, well-defined user interface, which puts all the important instrument controls up-front. This gives you a super-fast and efficient workflow, and makes it easy to manage the vast range of instruments on offer.\n\n\nDEEPTWEAKABILITY\n\nPlaying highly-responsive instruments is one thing -- tweaking, editing and creating instruments is another: KONTAKT 5 gives you both.\n\n[color=chocolate][b]With a detailed yet consistently straightforward interface, you can easily edit, loop, slice and time-stretch your sounds, pitch shift in real time or tempo-sync with the powerful Wave Editor.\n64 integrated effects provide a universal sound design toolset, brought to life by the powerful KONTAKT 5 sound engine with full surround sound support.\n\nFor deep editing, go under the hood and draw your own custom envelopes directly into the sample waveform. Or use step sequencers, flex envelopes and the new filters and effects to take your sound to entirely new places.\n\n\n\nSUPPORTED INTERFACES\n\nStand-alone\nVST\nAudio Units\nRTAS (Pro Tools 9 + 10)\nASIO\nCoreAudio\nWASAPI\nAAX Native (Pro Tools 10)\n64-bit AAX plugins (Pro Tools 11)\n\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nWindows 7 or Windows 8 (latest Service Pack, 32/64-bit), Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Run installer from kontakt folder not the update from R2R\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Patch with the unipatcher x86 or x64\n(patch dll and exe to avoid errors)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Patch with regpatch\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Burn or mount the image in R2R Update folder.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install the update.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ To use library for Kontakt Player/Intakt/Kompakt,\nyou need to add the information due to the protection scheme.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Run the Kontakt.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Click &quot;Libraries&quot; tab.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Click &quot;Add Library&quot; button.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Select the directory of the library.\n\nQuote:\nUNLOCKED NOTE :\n\nYou can edit the password protected script\nYou can use any libraries made for older versions.\nYou can edit libraries for Kontakt Player.\nYou can resave the library to decrypted one.\n\nAAX is cracked.
