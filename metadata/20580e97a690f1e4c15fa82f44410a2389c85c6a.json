  "description": "In the Land of Giants: Journeys Through the Dark Ages - Max Adams [epub]\r\n\r\nThe five centuries between the end of Roman Britain and the death of Alfred the Great have left few voices save a handful of chroniclers, but Britain's &quot;Dark Ages&quot; can still be explored through their material remnants: architecture, books, metalwork, and, above all, landscapes.\r\n\r\nMax Adams explores Britain's lost early medieval past by walking its paths and exploring its lasting imprint on valley, hill, and field. From York to Whitby, from London to Sutton Hoo, from Edinburgh to Anglesey, and from Hadrian's Wall to Loch Tay, each of his ten walking narratives form free-standing chapters as well as parts of a wider portrait of a Britain of fort and fyrd, crypt and crannog, church and causeway, holy well and memorial stone.\r\n\r\nPart travelogue, part expert reconstruction, In the Land of Giants offers a beautifully written insight into the lives of peasants, drengs, ceorls, thanes, monks, knights, and kings during an enigmatic but richly exciting period of Britainâ€™s history. 16 pages of maps and illustrations",
