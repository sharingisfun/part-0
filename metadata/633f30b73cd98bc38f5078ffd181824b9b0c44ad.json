  "description": "About This Game\r\nWhen Houdai is shot by cupid angel Ekoro, he becomes immensely popular and suddenly every girl at the academy becomes hot for him. But being irresistible is hardly a dream come true! Every love letter, shout of adulation, and advancing kisses drains his energy! And worse - if he doesn't find his one true love by the end of the day, he will become cursed and forever alone!\r\n\r\nâ€¢Gorgeous anime-styled rail-shooter action. Use your targeting cursor to fend off the advancing girls!\r\nâ€¢Story Mode: Play through the story and see if you can successfully confess your feelings to the girl of your dreams.\r\nâ€¢Score Attack: Play specific levels to achieve the highest scores.\r\nâ€¢Collection: Take a look at your achievements, image gallery and information on all the lovely ladies at the Academy!\r\nâ€¢Choose your own love interest. Your choices will change the story and the path you take throughout the game",
