He must discover his identity and save his wife from a warlord with a plan to bio-engineer soldiers.\r\n\r\nDirector: Ilya Naishuller\r\nWriters: Ilya Naishuller (screenwriter), Will Stewart (additional writing by)\r\nStars: Sharlto Copley, Tim Roth, Haley Bennett\r\nGenres: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\r\nCountry: Russia | USA\r\nLanguage: English | Russian\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: AVC 2100kbps HQ-2Pass\r\nResolution: 720x400 30fps\r\nAudio: AC3 2.0 Digital line audio\r\nSubtitles: English for foreign parts\r\nLanguage: English\r\nEncoder: CPG\r\nSample: included\r\n\r\nMovie\r\nits a first person shooter like call of duty etc... so you can expect lot of camera movements in a way it was shot, brutual fight scenes and some uncomfortable scenes, lot of blood and shit is there.. fully hardcore and unrated.\r\n\r\nEncode\r\nsource was fantastic, had usual issue nothing like we have'nt fixed it before, its a bit zommed in, its for reason though! very few people actually knew that. \r\ndid usual stuff then added slight sharp and some walter white blue math magic etc...\r\nit has some movements in middle for few mins nothing bad though, rest is steady but henry is not steady lol.. perspective is a bit off which i intentially did not touch, its already zoomed in so no need to cut more video.\r\nperspective fix cause less picture in end result. \r\nthen synced Exclusive-Thx Th0r Audio to my finish video lip to lip sync, audio required some work so did that.\r\nit has english subs for foreign parts but few subs are cropped half due to the way it was captured another reason there is no need to touch perspective and some are easily readable.\r\n\r\ni don't think we will see another version of this even if we did, it wont be equal to this quality.  sample included must check it first.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aqAt \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aqAx \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aqA6 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aqAV \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aqAu \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aqAv",
