  "description": "TeamViewer 10 is a simple and fast solution for remote control, desktop sharing and file transfer that works behind any firewall and NAT proxy. To connect to another computer just run TeamViewer on both machines without the need of an installation procedure. With the first start automatic partner IDs are generated on both computers. Enter your partnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ID into TeamViewer and the connection is established immediately. With many thousand users worldwide TeamViewer is a standard tool to give support and assistance to people in remote locations. The software can also be used for presentations, where you can show your own desktop to a partner. This application also is VNC compatible and offers secure, encrypted data transfer with maximum security.\n\nFeatures :\n\nPerformance optimizations\nTeamViewer 10 includes significant performance optimizations. CPU usage optimizations for multi-core processors, HD voice transmission quality, and faster login and load times for the Management Console are just a few examples.\n\nCentral setting policies\nApply setting policies, distribute them, and enforce them if necessary, all via the Management Console. Any changes to setting policies are automatically applied to all installations. IT Admins will be happy to know that importing .reg files is now a thing of the past.\n\nMaster whitelist\nPermit access to all your devices using just one whitelist. No longer worry about having to grant users access via the whitelist on each specific device. Also reduce administrative work now by adding companies to the whitelist instead of having to manage access rights for individual users.\n\nChat history and persistent chat groups\nRefer back to a previous discussion to find information or help resolve an issue. TeamViewer 10 provides a complete chat history for all conversations, and chats are end-to-end encrypted. Create persistent chat groups for ongoing discussions as well.\n\nOne-click video calls\nReach out to your colleagues using video and VoIP in exceptional quality for both image and audio without having to first start a meeting. See and talk to multiple participants simultaneously in a single call, and share your screen at any time. As always, security is paramount to TeamViewer, so video calls are end-to-end encrypted just as regular screen sharing meetings are.\n\nAdd your profile picture\nPut a face to your name and a personal touch to your online presence. Your profile picture is displayed in the Computers &amp; Contacts list, chat window, request dialogs, and similar locations where it helps to identify you and add to your professional image.\n\nAutomatically find nearby contacts\nQuickly find the right person or device with whom or which to share your screen or files. TeamViewer 10 now automatically displays nearby computers and contacts.\n\nUltra High Definition - 4K display - support\nUltra high definition monitors, also known as 4K displays, are becoming increasingly popular because of their incredible image fidelity. By means of intelligent scaling, TeamViewer 10 provides flawless connections to 4K displays for both remote control and meeting sessions.\n\nGreater emphasis on your corporate identity\nCustomizations are now applied to the download site for the custom modules as well as the waiting room for meetings and service cases. This gives your corporate identity a more prominent presence.\n\nReal-time session notes\nMaintain a protocol during a remote control session, or note something when it comes to mind. There is no need to wait until the end of a session to write comments.\n\nTeamViewer 10 redesign\nModern software should look the part. TeamViewer 10 boasts a streamlined design and convenient new shortcuts to commonly used features and options. TeamViewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already intuitive interface is now even easier to use.\n\nComputers &amp; Contacts API\nIntegrate your computers and contacts into any software by taking advantage of the Computers &amp; Contacts API. See, for example, when your customers are online, and establish a connection to them from within your software. Synchronize information, and easily access, manage, and edit your computers and contacts.\n\nIdle session timeout\nWith user-definable session timeout limits, supporters and their clients never have to worry about idle sessions remaining open.\n\nService cases in TeamViewer Host\nSet up spontaneous support in addition to unattended access. Users can request spontaneous support that automatically generates a service case. There is no need to run a different module.\n\nIntegration with Dropbox, Google Drive, and more\nShare files during meetings or remote control sessions by using Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Box. Have your files available to share from wherever you are. With your data already in the cloud, you save both time and bandwidth.\n\nDoor lock for online meetings\nDo some final prep work before unlocking the door, or encourage participants to be on time by locking the door after starting a meeting. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry though, you can always see who is waiting outside and invite them to join.\n\nWhiteboard for remote control\nThe whiteboard is now available during remote control. After all, a picture really can be worth a thousand words when trying to explain something. Both sides of the connection are able to use the whiteboard simultaneously as well.\n\nBlackBerry App (Preview)\nThe TeamViewer app for Remote Control is now available for BlackBerry.\n\nWhat's New :\n\nofficial site does not provide any info about changes in this version",
