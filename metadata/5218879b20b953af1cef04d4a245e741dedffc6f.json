  "description": "USB Disk Security is the best software to block threats that can damage your PC or compromise your personal information via USB storage.\n\n 100% protection against any malicious programs via USB drive\n\n USB Disk Security uses innovative technology to block known and unknown threats via USB drive. It supports USB drive, flash disk, secure digital card, thumb drive, pen drive, removable storage, ipod, and more. \n\n The best solution to protect offline computer\n Other antivirus software should update virus database regularly, and they cannot effectively protect offline computers that are not connected to the Internet. When new viruses, worms and other malicious attacks strike, traditional signatures are insufficient. Every minute one waits for a virus signature update creates a window of vulnerability that could have devastating consequences. USB Disk Security uses advanced proactive detection techniques, and closes the window of vulnerability left open by other reactive, signature-based responses. \n\n Data Protection\n Deliver high level of protection against theft and accidental disclosure of confidential data. This feature can prevent unauthorized persons from copying your data to USB drives, and it also can stop the threats from USB drive.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/19018481121126379041.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/19018481121126379041.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
