  "description": "      SoundToys Native Effects VST RTAS v4.1.6\n\n\nVersion 4.1.6 bug fixes include:\n\nFixed issue opening old sessions in Ableton Live.\nFixed issue causing &quot;min shift alerts&quot; occurring in EchoBoy.\nKey hits now go to host if not required by the plug-in. Sonar still blocks them.\nFixed issue where key hits caused graphic problems in Cubase.\nFixed issue causing double key hits in Ableton Live Mac VST.\nSimulated analog noise improved in FilterFreak.\nOther system reliability bugs fixed.\n\nEchoBoy Issue: This release seems to have introduced a serious issue with EchoBoy that slipped past testing. The problem (distorted audio) appears to only happen at higher sample rates. If you are working at sample rates above 48 kHz, please remain at the V4.1.5 release. Soundtoys apologize and will be looking into a fix as soon as possible.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.soundtoys.com/product/SoundToys%20Native%20Effects&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.soundtoys.com/product/SoundToys%20Native%20Effects&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSpecs\n\nRTAS Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Audio Units Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ AudioSuite Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ VST\n\nRequires Windows XP/Vista/7 (Pro Tools users see Avid system requirements)\n\nCompatible with Pro Tools, M-Powered, Digital Performer, Logic Pro, Cubase, Nuendo, Sonar and Live.
