  "description": "Testament - Brotherhood Of The Snake 2016 ak256\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Brotherhood Of The Snake&quot;, the twelfth album from San Francisco Bay Area thrash metal veterans TESTAMENT, will be released on October 28.\r\n\r\nAsked whether the musical direction of TESTAMENT's new material is a throwback to the band's early albums or if it's more similar to the recent TESTAMENT records, Eric said: &quot;More like the modern [TESTAMENT sound], but, you know, like I was saying earlier, having that more raw feeling. Of course, our influences have changed a lot. For me, I always get accused of listening to older stuff [and I am told that] I need to listen to more new stuff. But I always like to go back and listen to records from the '70s and the '80s. And I won't name the bands I listen to, but I listen to a lot.\r\n\r\nTESTAMENT will promote &quot;Brotherhood Of The Snake&quot; by teaming up with AMON AMARTH for a European tour this fall.\r\n\r\nThrash\r\nSubgenre:\tThrash Metal\r\nBitrate:\t256 k\r\nSize:\t92.85 MB \t\r\n11 files\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Brotherhood of the Snake\r\n02. The Pale King\r\n03. Stronghold\r\n04. Seven Seals\r\n05. Born in a Rut\r\n06. Centuries of Suffering\r\n07. Neptune's Spear\r\n08. Black Jack\r\n09.
