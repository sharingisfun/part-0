The idea to form a supergroup originated in 2001 on the Tattoo the Earth tour, although plans were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. The summer of 2006 allowed the band to take the project seriously and record its first album. Recorded at Chasin' Jason studio in Dimebag Darrell's backyard, a self-titled album was completed in roughly one month. Released on April 10, 2007, the album entered the Billboard 200 at number 9,selling 45,000 copies. Allmusic reviewer William Ruhlmann stated the album is &quot;a competent example of its genre&quot; awarding the album three and a half stars.Formation and early days\n\nHellyeah's beginnings can be traced back to 2000 on the Tattoo the Earth tour featuring Mudvayne, Nothingface, Slayer, Slipknot and Sevendust. Nothingface guitarist Tom Maxwell became friends with Mudvayne vocalist Chad Gray, and they talked about the possibility of forming a supergroup. The following year, Nothingface toured with Mudvayne and talks to form the supergroup continued, although were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. At this time, Gray and Maxwell had brainstormed five band names.\n\nMudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett approached Maxwell &quot;out of the blue&quot; and wanted to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out and the search for a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music after the death of his brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18 month hiatus: &quot;It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [Gray] and Tom [Maxwell], they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12&quot; vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'&quot;\n\nThe band's persistence paid off and Paul joined the project. Paul commented about joining the project: &quot;Everybody had their head in the right place and that let's-tear-the-world-a-new-ass attitude&quot;.\n\nIn their previous bands, there had only been one guitarist, so having two was a new experience for all members. Paul felt two guitarists brought back the &quot;old school Iron Maiden thing where they play two parts and give you a grinding rhythm part with a badass melody on top&quot;. In 2006, Mudvayne did not have any plans to tour and were taking most of the summer and fall off, while Nothingface was preparing to record their next album. The time over the summer allowed the band to pursue the project which had been talked about for years.\n\nGray flew into Baltimore to Nothingface's home studio to discuss the project further. The song &quot;Waging War&quot; was written in two days, followed by Maxwell tracking it the next day, and Gray completing vocals. During the summer of 2006, schedules were clear, which allowed members to take the time to record a studio album. The album was recorded at Paul's backyard studio, Chasin' Jason in Arlington, Texas. Filled with photos of his late brother Dimebag, Paul found it tough entering the studio where the last albums by Damageplan and Pantera, and the collaboration Rebel Meets Rebel were recorded, but felt &quot;the dark cloud that was there went away&quot;, due to everyone's positive energy. Maxwell and Tribbett were the primary writers of the album, and Paul was there to &quot;steer them in the right direction&quot;, with Gray adding his opinion on musical arrangements.\n\nPaul built the members a cabana style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt comfortable while recording. Paul produced the record and Gray felt Paul &quot;facilitated the whole thing&quot;. The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14 day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to &quot;re charge the batteries&quot;, and &quot;get a fresh head&quot;. As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it on a piece of paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote &quot;Hellyeah&quot;, and the band thought it was a perfect choice. Paul says it's &quot;very affirmative and full of attitude. When your buddy asks if you want to get a beer tonight, you don't just say 'yes,' you say, &quot;Hell yeah!&quot;. Gray attributes the name to &quot;late teens, keggers and chicks and AC/DC and Metallica&quot;.\nHellyeah (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008)\nMain article: Hellyeah (album)\n\nThe album peaked on the Top Hard Rock albums at number 15, and number 3 on the Top Rock Albums. As of October 18, 2007, the album has sold 204,000 copies.\n\nHellyeah received generally positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic awarded the album three and a half stars out of five, commenting; &quot;Their album is a competent example of its genre, in which Tribbett and Maxwell combine to create crushing riffs over the pummeling rhythm section of Paul, while Gray howls typically enraged, expletive-littered lyrics to songs&quot;. However,  &quot;it's a set of good songs recorded by 5 accomplished musicians from diverse backgrounds not letting their pasts define them and those songs in one form or another speak to you in different ways&quot;.\n\nBassist Montano was asked to leave Hellyeah after the album's release party, where he assaulted guitarist Tom Maxwell and made numerous gun threats while heavily intoxicated. The band's publicist stated his departure was due to &quot;personal reasons on both sides&quot; The band considered Damageplan bassist Bob Zilla as Paul thought; &quot;It was kind hard to go ahead and commit to this band without Bob being part of it&quot;. Zilla was invited to audition and got the gig immediately.\n\nHellyeah embarked on their first tour on May 2007 titled Fire it Up, made an appearance at the Download Festival, and underwent Australian tour in July 2007. The Family Values Tour with Korn and Evanescence, saw the band start touring in late July, which also consisted playing with Alter Bridge in San Antonio before passing through thirty cities before ending in Washington, D.C. \nStampede (2009Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2010)\n\nHellyeah headlined a tour in the spring of 2010 with: Seether, Five Finger Death Punch, Drowning Pool, and Lacuna Coil. The first date was May 11, 2010 in Madison, WI. They were also confirmed to play the main stage at Download Festival 2010. In 2009, the band revealed that they were in the studio recording a new album, later revealed to be titled Stampede.\n\nFor Stampede, the members went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a recording process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, surrounded by the obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music,&quot; Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. The methods may have been unorthodox, but the result was nothing short of magical. &quot;We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it,&quot; guitarist Tom Maxwell said.\n\n&quot;Cowboy Way&quot;, a song from the new album, was released for a free download via the band's website on April 21, 2010. The music video for &quot;Cowboy Way&quot; premiered on May 20, 2010. The first single, &quot;Hell of a Time&quot;, was released on June 1, 2010. The music video for &quot;Hell of a Time&quot; premiered on June 16, 2010. The song, &quot;The Debt That All Men Pay&quot; premiered on ultimateguitar.com on June 22, 2010. Stampede was released on July 13, 2010 via Epic Records and sold 28,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, making it the band's highest charting album to date.\n\nThe group was recently confirmed to be playing the Rock Star Uproar Festival along with other headliners Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold, Stone Sour and Halestorm.\nBand of Brothers (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012)\n\n\nHellyeah finished recording a new album, titled Band of Brothers, and are extremely satisfied with the production of the record; which was produced by Jeremy Parker, who has produced albums for Godsmack and Evanescence, and was recorded in the home of drummer Vinnie Paul's studio in Arlington, Texas; VP's Upstairs Studio. The direction of the album is said to be heavier and more metal-oriented than its predecessors, fusing the different influences of the band members (Pantera, Mudvayne, Damageplan, Nothingface) together for a more metal approach. Band of Brothers was released everywhere on July 17, 2012 &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; was released in early May with a music video and will be released on iTunes. On May 8, 2012, the band's second single off their 3rd album of the same name, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; was released.\n\n\nLineup changes and Blood for Blood (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nIn late 2013, the band has posted updates to their Facebook page, detailing that they are in the process of writing and recording their next album.
