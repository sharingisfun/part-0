Across the broad ?eld of art and design, artists and designers will use drawing as a speci?c tool for visual communication, and at the same time use a wide spectrum of drawing techniques to express, develop, and present their ideas and work to the viewer for what ever reason. \nTherefore, it is impossible to make a drawing unless the artist has a clear understanding of the type of drawing that is to be created, and the visual language that is to be used which will give form and expressive dynamics to the drawing. This is often forgotten or misunderstood by most teachers of drawing. \n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a099347c8cc771b9a93ba5c0f1b82c08005bcefb","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Book+of+Drawing+Techniques+%5BPDF%5D+-+Oceanhawk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a099347c8cc771b9a93ba5c0f1b82c08005bcefb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,153,52,124,140,199,113,185,169,59,165,192,241,184,44,8,0,91,206,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
