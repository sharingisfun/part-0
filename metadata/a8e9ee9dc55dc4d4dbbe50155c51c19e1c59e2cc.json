  "description": "Hello, so if you're looking for a Minecraft launcher that is cracked and is able to download any version of minecraft - this the launcher for you. It does not have any product advertisements...or open random websites up...like some other launchers do. It's simply a cracked launcher and it looks almost identical to the launcher mojang supply. \r\n\r\nOur launcher is also 100% virus free...and youre more than welcome to scan it before installing it. As a personal note. To make things easier for you all, I have made this an installation-type file not just a .jar file e.t.c. All you have to do is follow the instructions below.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1) Run the installation wizard\r\n2) Open Minecraft from the shortcut on your desktop\r\n3) Select location to save all minecraft files/data from Mojang\r\n4) Enter name and press Login\r\n5) Play online or single player and enjoy! \r\n\r\nPlease note: When you run the launcher, ensure that you run the launcher as Admin at least the first time, this is because it will prompt you for a directory where you would like to store all of the minecraft files that is downloaded from the Mojang servers. If the location you specify is outside of the areas that your account can save files to then it will not work correctly. It's better to set it to run as admin",
