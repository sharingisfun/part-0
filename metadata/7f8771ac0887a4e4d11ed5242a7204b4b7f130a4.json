  "description": "This documentary catalogs the sorted history of corporate-ggovernmental partnerships that transformed wholesome foods into poisonous, genetically engineered travesties in the U.S.. It all began inside the NAZI super weapons laboratories, and now the genetic/chemical food bastardizations that grew from those technologies are followed by one cover-up after another.  The horrific list of rampant and chronic diseases grows, as most Americans remain unaware that the majority of their foods are genetically engineered, and still contaminanted by pesticides that were outlawed decades ago.  Other nations have typically banned genetically engineered foods, but they are not even labeled in the U.S..\n\nThis is a good quality, compressed, Xvid/AVI formatted version, with all movie segments joined in-order.
