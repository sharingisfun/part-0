It intelligently smoothens and removes imperfections while preserving skin texture and other important portrait details such as hair, eyebrows, eyelashes etc.\n\nPortraiture features a powerful masking tool that enables selective smoothening only in the skin tone areas of the image. What makes Portraiture's masking tool truly unique is its built-in Auto-Mask feature. It helps you quickly discover most of the skin tone range of the image automatically and, if preferred, you can manually fine-tune it to ensure optimal results, providing unmatched precision and productivity.\n\nFor finer control, you can specify the smoothening degree for different detail sizes and adjust the sharpness, softness, warmth, brightness and contrast.\n\nPortraiture comes with pre-defined presets for one-click effects and, as with all Imagenomic plugins, you can capture your own signature workflow in a custom preset tailored to your specific requirements and photographic portfolio.\n\nImagenomic Noiseware 5.0.3 Build 5030 - The Better way to remove Noise\n\nNoiseware is a high-performance noise suppression software tool designed to decrease or eliminate noise from digital photo or scanned images.\n\nUnlike most image processing software techniques that utilize simple methods (such as median filters) to treat digital noise in images, Noiseware features a sophisticated yet fast noise filtering algorithm.\n\nUsing the adaptive noise profile capability and sharpening function, Noiseware greatly reduces the visible noise while preserving the details in the images.\n\nImagenomic RealGrain 2.0.1 Build 2010 - Real Effects with Realgrain\n\nIf you long for the darkroom age, the soft, warm graininess of the film, or you seek to infuse that fuzzy, retro look or perhaps enhance your digital photos by simulating the greater range and texture of traditional film, then Realgrain is the plugin for you.\n\nRealgrain features versatile methods for simulating the grain patterns, the color and the tonal response of different films and different scan resolutions to convey a truly film-like image effect.\n\nBecause Realgrain enables you to automatically adjust the grain size based on the physical image dimensions, it can dynamically render accurate grain patterns for varying image sizes.\n\nRealgrain's controls for grain balance, tonal and color fine-tuning enable you to generate superior output quality and picture vibrancy, and are simple and easy-to-use for a truly intuitive workflow experience.\n\nPlus, Realgrain comes with precision presets for a range of default effect options. You can also capture your own signature workflow through custom presets tailored to your specific requirements and individual photographs.\n\nOperating systems : Windows XP (32 bit) / Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8\n\nCompatible host programs :\nAdobe Photoshop CS4 / CS5 / CS6 / CC\nAdobe Photoshop Elements 8 / 9 / 10 / 11\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagenomic.com/pt.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagenomic.com/pt.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5018516b9291b2a2817e406d460bcb88ff144481","amp;dn":"Imagenomic+Plugin+Suite+%28for+Photoshop%29+Aug-2014+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5018516b9291b2a2817e406d460bcb88ff144481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,24,81,107,146,145,178,162,129,126,64,109,70,11,203,136,255,20,68,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
