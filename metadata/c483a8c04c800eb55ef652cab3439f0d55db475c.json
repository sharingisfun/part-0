For some reason the family has always mistreated him. On his 11th birthday a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard Voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.\n\nSeed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c483a8c04c800eb55ef652cab3439f0d55db475c","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+the+Philosophers+Stone+%282001%29+720p-550MB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c483a8c04c800eb55ef652cab3439f0d55db475c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,131,168,192,76,128,14,181,94,246,82,202,179,67,159,13,85,219,71,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
