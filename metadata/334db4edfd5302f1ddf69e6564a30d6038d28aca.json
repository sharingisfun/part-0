  "description": "John Lee Hooker\nThe Very Best Of\nJohn Lee Hooker (1995)\n\n\n\nHe was beloved worldwide as the king of the endless boogie, a genuine blues superstar whose droning, hypnotic one-chord grooves were at once both ultra-primitive and timeless. But John Lee Hooker recorded in a great many more styles than that over a career that stretched across more than half a century.\n\n&quot;The Hook&quot; was a Mississippi native who became the top gent on the Detroit blues circuit in the years following World War II. The seeds for his eerily mournful guitar sound were planted by his stepfather, Will Moore, while Hooker was in his teens. Hooker had been singing spirituals before that, but the blues took hold and simply wouldn't let go. Overnight visitors left their mark on the youth, too: legends like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton, and Blind Blake, who all knew Moore.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tBlues\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Boogie Chillen'\n02.Crawlin' King Snake\n03.Hobo Blues\n04.Huckle Up Baby\n05.I'm In The Mood\n06.I Need Some Money\n07.Dimples\n08.Boom Boom\n09.Shake It Baby\n10.Big Legs, Tight Skirt\n11.It Serves You Right To Suffer\n12.You Know, I Know\n13.One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\n14.I'm Bad Like Jesse James\n15.Burning Hell\n16.Terraplane Blues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n",
