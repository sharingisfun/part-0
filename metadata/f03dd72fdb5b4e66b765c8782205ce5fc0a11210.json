  "description": "&quot;Hannibal&quot; -- One of the most fascinating literary characters comes to life on television for the first time: psychiatrist-turned-serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. In this new drama from Bryan Fuller (&quot;Pushing Daisies,&quot; &quot;Heroes&quot;), based on the characters from Thomas Harris' classic novels, we see where this incredible story began.\n\nWill Graham is a gifted criminal profiler who is on the hunt for a serial killer with the FBI. Graham's unique way of thinking gives him the astonishing ability to empathize with anyone - even psychopaths. He seems to know what makes them tick. But when the mind of the twisted killer he's pursuing is too complicated for even Will to comprehend, he enlists the help of Dr. Lecter, one of the premier psychiatric minds in the country. Armed with the uncanny expertise of the brilliant doctor, Will and Hannibal (known as a serial killer only to the audience) form a brilliant partnership and it seems there's no villain they can't catch. If Will only knew...\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x404\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo",
