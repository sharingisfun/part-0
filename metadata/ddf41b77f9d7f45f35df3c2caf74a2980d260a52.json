For one, Eirik Boe is equally comfortable talking about the record's &quot;serious ideas&quot; and laughing about its' &quot;hi-brow Bossa Nova&quot; moments while his partner Erlend Oye is clearly thrilled by making, &quot;the most rhythmical pop record ever that features no percussion or drums.&quot; For another, there is no one who makes records like they do. &quot;When we started out we were afraid of sounding like other artists,&quot; Erlend says. &quot;But now we feel pretty much alone.&quot; But the most striking thing about this album is how powerfully it reminds you that making music together is not a game, it's not something to be undertaken lightly, this record is part of a much larger picture, a long and involved relationship that has had its good and bad times. Declaration of Dependence is the story of two people living two very different lives sensing that they are immensely more powerful together than apart. In that sense it is the most adult, the most mature record Kings of Convenience have ever made. That it is their most gripping, their most revealing is, if anything, just a by-product of that honesty and their endeavour. &quot;Erlend is a very stubborn individual with extreme belief in his own ideas,&quot; says Eirik of his partner. &quot;He's very free and creative and his access to unusual and fresh ideas is very good. I find that quite unique. For some reason they are very similar to my ideas on music - we like the same unusualness.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf41b77f9d7f45f35df3c2caf74a2980d260a52","amp;dn":"Kings+of+Convenience+-+Declaration+of+Dependence+%5Bmp3-160-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf41b77f9d7f45f35df3c2caf74a2980d260a52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,244,27,119,249,215,244,95,53,223,60,44,175,116,162,152,13,38,10,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
