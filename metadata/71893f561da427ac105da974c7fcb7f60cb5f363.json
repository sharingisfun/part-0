  "description": "Pushkin: A Biography - T.J. Binyon [epub]\r\n\r\nIn the course of his short, dramatic life, Aleksandr Pushkin gave Russia not only its greatest poetryâ€“including the novel-in-verse Eugene Oneginâ€“but a new literary language. He also gave it a figure of enduring romantic allureâ€“fiery, restless, extravagant, a prodigal gambler and inveterate seducer of women. Having forged a dazzling, controversial career that cost him the enmity of one tsar and won him the patronage of another, he died at the age of thirty-eight, following a duel with a French officer who was paying unscrupulous attention to his wife.\r\n\r\nIn his magnificent, prizewinning Pushkin, T. J. Binyon lifts the veil of the iconic poetâ€™s myth to reveal the complexity and pathos of his life while brilliantly evoking Russia in all its nineteenth-century splendor. Combining exemplary scholarship with the pace and detail of a great novel, Pushkin elevates biography to a work of art",
