  "description": "NOW A #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“CompellingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.Kaku thinks with great breadth, and the vistas he presents us are worth the tripÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n*Ã¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n\nThe New York Times best-selling author of PHYSICS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE, PHYSICS OF THE FUTURE and HYPERSPACE tackles the most fascinating and complex object in the known universe: the human brain. \n\nFor the first time in history, the secrets of the living brain are being revealed by a battery of high tech brain scans devised by physicists. Now what was once solely the province of science fiction has become a startling reality. Recording memories, telepathy, videotaping our dreams, mind control, avatars, and telekinesis are not only possible; they already exist. \n \nTHE FUTURE OF THE MIND *gives us an authoritative and compelling look at the astonishing research being done in top laboratories around the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€all based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and physics.  One day we might have a &quot;smart pill&quot; that can enhance our cognition; be able to upload our brain to a computer, neuron for neuron; send thoughts and emotions around the world on a &quot;brain-net&quot;; control computers and robots with our mind; push the very limits of immortality; and perhaps even send our consciousness across the universe. \n\nDr. Kaku takes us on a grand tour of what the future might hold, giving us not only a solid sense of how the brain functions but also how these technologies will change our daily lives. He even presents a radically new way to think about &quot;consciousness&quot; and applies it to provide fresh insight into mental illness, artificial intelligence and alien consciousness.  \n\nWith Dr. Kaku's deep understanding of modern science and keen eye for future developments, THE FUTURE OF THE MIND is a scientific tour de force--an extraordinary, mind-boggling exploration of the frontiers of neuroscience.\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nFacts to ponder: there are as many stars in our galaxy (about 100 billion) as there are neurons in your brain; your cell phone has more computing power than NASA had when it landed Apollo 11 on the moon. These seemingly unrelated facts tell us two things: our brains are magnificently complex organisms, and science fiction has a way of becoming reality rather quickly. This deeply fascinating book by theoretical physicist Kaku explores what might be in store for our minds: practical telepathy and telekinesis; artificial memories implanted into our brains; and a pill that will make us smarter. He describes work being done right now on using sensors to read images in the human brain and on downloading artificial memories into the brain to treat victims of strokes and AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. SF fans might experience a sort of breathless thrill when reading the bookÃ¢â‚¬â€This stuff is happening! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really happening!Ã¢â‚¬â€and for general readers who have never really thought of the brain in all its glorious complexity and potential, the book could be a seriously mind-opening experience. --David Pitt\n\nReview\n\nPraise for The Future of the Mind,  #1 New York Times Bestseller\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“CompellingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Kaku thinks with great breadth, and the vistas he presents us are worth the tripÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n *\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IntriguingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.extraordinary findingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦A fascinating sprint through everything from telepathy research to the 147,456 processors of the Blue Gene computer, which has been used to simulate 4.5% of the brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s synapses and neuronsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Nature\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fizzes with his characteristic effervescenceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.FascinatingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.. For all his talk of surrogates and intelligent robots, no manufactured being could have a fraction of his charisma.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Independent\n *\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A mind-bending study of the possibilities of the brain....a clear and readable guide to what is going on at a time of astonishingly rapid change.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Telegraph \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In this expansive, illuminating journey through the mind, theoretical physicist Kaku (Physics of the Future) explores fantastical realms of science fiction that may soon become our reality. His futurist framework merges physics with neuroscience... applied to demonstrations that Ã¢â‚¬Å“show proof-of-principleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in accomplishing what was previously fictional: that minds can be read, memories can be digitally stored, and intelligences can be improved to great extents. The discussion, while heavily scientific, is engaging, clear, and replete with cinematic references... These new mental frontiers make for captivating readingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-Publishers Weekly \n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Kaku turns his attention to the human mind with equally satisfying resultsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Telepathy is no longer a fantasy since scanners can already detect, if crudely, what a subject is thinking, and genetics and biochemistry now allow researchers to alter memories and increase intelligence in animals. Direct electrical stimulation of distinct brain regions has changed behavior, awakened comatose patients, relieved depression, and produced out-of-body and religious experiencesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Kaku is not shy about quoting science-fiction movies and TV (he has seen them all)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ he delivers ingenious predictions extrapolated from good research already in progress.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½                                                                                                                                     \n-Kirkus Reviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Facts to ponder: there are as many stars in our galaxy (about 100 billion) as there are neurons in your brain; your cell phone has more computing power than NASA had when it landed Apollo 11 on the moon.

And just a little bit spooky&quot;--USA Today\n \nPraise for Physics of the Impossible\n \n&quot;An invigorating experience&quot;\n-The Christian Science Monitor\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Kaku's latest book aims to explain exactly why some visions of the future may eventually be realized while others are likely to remain beyond the bounds of possibility. . . . Science fiction often explores such questions; science falls silent at this point. Kaku's work helps to fill a void.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€The Economist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Mighty few theoretical physicists would bother expounding some of these possible impossibilities, and Kaku is to be congratulated for doing so. . . .
