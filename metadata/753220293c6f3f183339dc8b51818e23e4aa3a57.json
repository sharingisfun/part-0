  "description": "Artist: War On Drugs\nTitle Of Album: Lost in the Dream\nYear Of Release: 2014\nLabel: Secretly Canadian\nGenre: Indie Rock\nQuality: 320kbps\nTotal Time: 60:22 min\nTotal Size: 140 MB\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Under the Pressure \n2. Red Eyes \n3. Suffering \n4. An Ocean in Between the Waves \n5. Disappearing \n6. Eyes to the Wind \n7. The Haunting Idle \n8. Burning \n9. Lost in the Dream \n10. In Reverse\n\nThe War on Drugs have been relatively quiet since their awesome 2011 record Slave Ambient, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just announced the details of a long-awaited follow-up, and leaked a first single too. Secretly Canadian will release Lost in the Dream in March, but you can sample Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red EyesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ now; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lovely song that sounds a little like its title, waking up still a little out of it with an array of hazy, nostalgic, fragmented memories. Get lost in that shimmering background organ and Adam GranducielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreamy vocals while you peruse the tracklist below Ã¢â‚¬â€œ remember, you can pick up the album in a record store starting March 18.",
