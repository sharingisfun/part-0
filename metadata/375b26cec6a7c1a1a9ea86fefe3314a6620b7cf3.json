  "description": "With a steady evolution from their early days as a speed metal band to their current, renowned musical alchemy of glory, drama, and grandiosity, GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blind Guardian have long since made their mark as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitive melodic/progressive rock band. For many, they need no introduction, as the band possesses a track record and back catalogue of classic staples that perhaps only Iron Maiden can match. Called everything from heavy metal bards to modern-day minstrels, BLIND GUARDIAN possess the ability to transport their legions of fans to new landscapes with their majestic songwriting, fantastically themed lyrics, and their meticulous, emotion-packed music.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœBeyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the title of the highly-anticipated tenth studio album by GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite sons and metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most epic storytellers BLIND GUARDIAN. Prepare to have your senses overwhelmed. Four-and-a-half years in the making, the follow-up to 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœAt The Edge Of TimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (which debuted at #2 on the German album charts and at #1 on the American Billboard Heatseekers chart &amp; #108 on the American Billboard Top 200 Albums chart) is scheduled for release in the UK on February 2nd 2015 and February 3rd 2015 in North America.\n\n\nRecorded at Twilight Hall Studio in Grefrath, Germany and produced by Charlie Bauerfeind (SAXON, HAMMERFALL, HELLOWEEN), Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ showcases BLIND GUARDIANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-awaited collaborative work with three different classical choirs: one from the Czech Republic (Prague), one from Hungary (Budapest), and one from the United States (Boston). Two grand orchestras Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each featuring 90 musicians Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also lend their brilliant talents to the new recordings with absolutely spellbinding results.\n\nTransporting listeners via a mysteriously powerful red mirror into an otherworldly dimension that includes tyrants, gods, and the Holy Grail, the ten songs comprising Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story lines revolve around the young protagonist we first met twenty years ago in the 1995 tracks Ã¢â‚¬ËœBright EyesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAnd The Story EndsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A story between science fiction and fantasyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, explains BLIND GUARDIAN vocalist &amp; lyricist Hansi KÃƒÂ¼rsch. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The story begins with our 1995 album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœImaginations From The Other SideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The two worlds described therein have changed dramatically for the worse since then. While there used to be several passages between the worlds, there is only one gate left now: The Red Mirror. It has to be found at any cost.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nAsked to describe the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guiding principles for the creation of this new release, BLIND GUARDIAN guitarist AndrÃƒÂ© Olbrich shares: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We want to surprise and impress with our music. Nowadays, music tends to be arbitrary and predictable. But we want to keep developing our music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nOpening with a tidal wave of surging emotion courtesy of a spine-tingling choir Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unleashes its first gem, Ã¢â‚¬ËœNinth WaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a consciousness-expanding palette of landscapes and moods bearing the message of an urgent mission still seeking resolution. Closing with an explosion of heroic harmonies &amp; choral glories with a nine-and-a-half minute, self-contained saga Ã¢â‚¬ËœGrand ParadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the best song we have ever writtenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Olbrich), the grandiose, uplifting, and ingenious storytelling in Ã¢â‚¬ËœBeyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is guaranteed to leave you breathless.\n\nimage\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nFrederik Ehmke: Drums\nHansi KÃƒÂ¼rsch: Lead and Backing Vocals\nMarcus Siepen: Rhythm Guitar\nAndrÃƒÂ© Olbrich: Lead, Rhythm and Acoustic Guitar\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
