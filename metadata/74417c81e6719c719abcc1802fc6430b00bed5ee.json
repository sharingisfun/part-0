  "description": "Limp Bizkit (alternately written as limpbizkit) is a rapcore / nu metal band from Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nThey are often credited, along with their discoverers Korn, for creating the nu metal genre and starting to widen its popularity. Limp Bizkit was very popular during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and their albums have sold over 31 million copies worldwide. Limp Bizkit&amp;#039;s current members are vocalist Fred Durst, bassist Sam Rivers, drummer John Otto (Rivers&amp;#039; cousin), and Latvian turntablist/sampler player DJ Lethal. The band&amp;#039;s guitarist Wes Borland departed in 2001 following the release of their first three albums to be replaced by Mike Smith for the band&amp;#039;s fourth release Results May Vary. Wes rejoined for The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) only to quit once again in 2006 to work with other projects Black Light Burns and From First to Last. It&amp;#039;s unknown if Wes will rejoin Limp Bizkit in 2007 for The Unquestionable Truth (Part 2).\n*******************************************\nLimp Bizkit&amp;#039;s first greatest hits compilation, titled Greatest Hitz, was released on November the 8th in 2005. It contained material from the band&amp;#039;s first four albums (the track The Truth was released in some countries). An additional DVD, which featured music videos for most of their major hits, was released in conjunction with the CD. The album and DVD were heavily promoted by the band&amp;#039;s label, even to the point where Durst claimed he was being forced to do interviews about a compilation he wasn&amp;#039;t very excited about.[13] The promotion did not pay off, with the album debuting at number 47. The compilation album featured 3 previously unreleased songs, &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;Lean On Me&quot;, which were acoustic-based leftovers from Results May Vary, dropped for heavier songs[14], and a medley of The Verve&amp;#039;s &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; and MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e&amp;#039;s &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;, which was released to radio but did not receive much airplay. Wes Borland stated that the CD was a &quot;piece of crap and a waste of money&quot;.\n\nProduct Details\n    * Original Release Date: November 8, 2005\n    * Number of Discs: 1\n    * Label: Geffen Records\n\nTrack Listing\n***\n1.
