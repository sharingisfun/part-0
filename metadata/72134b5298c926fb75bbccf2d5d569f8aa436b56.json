  "description": "Sim2 AIO (all all expansions, updates and languages, including SWEDISH)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the full game of Sims 2 with all expansion and service packs installed. Basically this unpacks the full game and makes the required reg keys. Thereby dodging a good 3 hour install with serial input. I didn't put in the reg keys for body shop. I've only tested this on two systems. An XP system and a Win7 system. It should work. If not, please report below.\n\nThis pack includes:\n\nApartment Life\nBon Voyage\nCelebration Stuff\nFamily Fun Stuff\nFreeTime\nGlamour Life Stuff\nH&amp;MÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Fashion Stuff\nHappy Holiday Stuff\nHoliday Party Pack\nIKEA Home Stuff\nKitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff\nMansion and Garden Stuff\nNightlife\nOpen for Business\nPets\nSeasons\nTeen Style Stuff\nUniversity\n\nThanks to:\nMy sister - Pestered the hell out of me to do this.\nNSIS - It's the installer\nReg Plugin - I needed to mess with the registry for this to work.\nEA Games - If it wasn't for your slave driving salaried employment tactics I wouldn't have to do this to begin with. Burn in hell. It's the developers that make your games, not your over paid CEO's.\nFFF - Nice keygen, I hope you make more mass keygens.\n\nThis installs the game and an uninstaller. It also includes the needed Direct X drivers.\n\nWhen installing, make sure to install it as Administrator as this does effect the registry. If the game still won't install stop the torrent and restart your computer.\n\n-- Other Data --\nNSIS Files -\n\n\nRegistry Plugin for NSIS -\n\n-------------\n                                                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MartinBLCK/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/MartinBLCK/&lt;/a&gt;\t",
