The one-hour drama follows Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey, an ambitious politician with his eye on the top job. With the Secretary of State promotion he was hoping for out of reach, Frank seeks to right the wrong that has been done to him.\n\nIn a modern day Washington D.C., the series managed to impress the audiences and gathered quite a following. The series was previously a BBC miniseries and based on a book by Michael Dobbs. Netflix streamed the series. The USA version of the show also stars: Robin Wright, Kate Mara, and Corey Stoll.\n\nSet in current day Washington DC, Season 2 deals with topics such as entitlements, Chinese cyberespionage, anthrax scares, parliamentary procedure, and government shutdowns. It begins at the exact time that season 1 ended with the Underwoods jogging in triumph. Upon returning home, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) informs them that the Slugline crew is investigating curious links that they have found. Once Frank gets back to his dirty dealing, he begins with attempting to erase all links to season 1's death of Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military vet and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing. During Sharp's pursuit of the position, she earn's Frank's approval. Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) abandons her season 1 sexual and political partnership with Frank to pursue leads about the real story behind Russo's death while allying with Janine Skorsky (Constance Zimmer) and her boyfriend Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus). Among the leads is Russo's prostitute (Rachel Brosnahan) who was an accomplice to the murder. Claire continues her battles with Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt), the pregnant former employee who is her non-profit's counterparty. Frank also spends time undermining the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advisor, Raymond Tusk (Gerald McRaney) and doing his best denigrating tea party loyalists. Underwood does manage to negotiate the federal budget plan.\n\nAmong the new cast members in season 2 are Molly Parker and Sam Page, while directors include Carl Franklin, Jodie Foster, James Foley and Wright.
