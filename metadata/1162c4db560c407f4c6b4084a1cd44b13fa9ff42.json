  "description": "The Panama Papers: How the Rich and Powerful Hide Their Money - Bastian Obermayer, Frederik Obermaier [epub]\r\n\r\nLate one evening, investigative journalist Bastian Obermayer receives an anonymous message offering him access to secret data. Through encrypted channels, he then receives documents showing a mysterious bank transfer for $500 million in gold. This is just the beginning.\r\n\r\nObermayer and fellow SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung journalist Frederik Obermaier find themselves immersed in the secret world where complex networks of shell companies help to hide people who don't want to be found. Faced with the largest data leak in history, they activate an international network of journalists to follow every possible line of enquiry. Operating for over a year in the strictest secrecy, they uncover a global elite living by a different set of rules: prime ministers, dictators, oligarchs, princelings, sports officials, big banks, arms smugglers, mafiosi, diamond miners, art dealers and celebrities.\r\n\r\nThe real-life thriller behind the story of the century, The Panama Papers is an intense, unputdownable account that blows their secret world wide open",
