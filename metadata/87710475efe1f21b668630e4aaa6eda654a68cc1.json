  "description": "Python in Practice: Create Better Programs Using Concurrency, Libraries, and Patterns \nSeries: Developer's Library\nPublished: August 20, 2013\nPublisher: Addison-Wesley Professional\nISBN: 9780321905635\nFormat: Retail Epub\nReader Required: Adobe Digital Editions, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\nFormat conversion: convert epub to mobi (Kindle) with Calibre\nYou can download the developer's source code without registering (link in book).\nPlease allow a couple seconds for the seedboxes to kick in, then it should move pretty quick.\nEnjoy! :D\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Whether you are an experienced programmer or are starting your career, Python in Practice is full of valuable advice and example to help you improve your craft by thinking about problems from different perspectives, introducing tools, and detailing techniques to create more effective solutions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œDoug Hellmann, Senior Developer, DreamHost\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re an experienced Python programmer, Python in Practice will help you improve the quality, reliability, speed, maintainability, and usability of all your Python programs.\nMark Summerfield focuses on four key themes: design patterns for coding elegance, faster processing through concurrency and compiled Python (Cython), high-level networking, and graphics. He identifies well-proven design patterns that are useful in Python, illuminates them with expert-quality code, and explains why some object-oriented design patterns are irrelevant to Python. He also explodes several counterproductive myths about Python programmingÃ¢â‚¬â€œshowing, for example, how Python can take full advantage of multicore hardware.\n\nAll examples, including three complete case studies, have been tested with Python 3.3 (and, where possible, Python 3.2 and 3.1) and crafted to maintain compatibility with future Python 3.x versions. All code has been tested on Linux, and most code has also been tested on OS X and Windows. All code may be downloaded at www.qtrac.eu/pipbook.html.\n\nCoverage includes\n-Leveraging PythonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most effective creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns\n-Supporting concurrency with PythonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multiprocessing, threading, and concurrent.futures modules\n-Avoiding concurrency problems using thread-safe queues and futures rather than fragile locks\n-Simplifying networking with high-level modules, including xmlrpclib and RPyC\n-Accelerating Python code with Cython, C-based Python modules, profiling, and other techniques\n-Creating modern-looking GUI applications with Tkinter\n-Leveraging todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful graphics hardware via the OpenGL API using pyglet and PyOpenGL\n",
