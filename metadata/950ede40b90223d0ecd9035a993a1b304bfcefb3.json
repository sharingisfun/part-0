Any character that was broken by this specific bug should also be fixed, and should reappear in your character select screen.\r\n\r\nGenre: Action - Adventure - Sandbox\r\nWorks on: Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Mac OS X (10.9.0+) and Linux (Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04)\r\nLanguages: Audio and text: English\r\nFeatures: single-player - multi-player - co-op\r\nReleased: July 22, 2016\r\nSize: 1.4 GB\r\nCompany: Chucklefish / Chucklefish\r\nStore page: https://www.gog.com/game/starbound\r\n\r\nAbout: \r\nYouâ€™ve fled your home, only to find yourself lost in space with a damaged ship. Your only option is to beam down to the planet below and gather the resources you need to repair your ship and set off to explore the vast, infinite universeâ€¦\r\n\r\nIn Starbound, you create your own story - thereâ€™s no wrong way to play! You may choose to save the universe from the forces that destroyed your home, uncovering greater galactic mysteries in the process, or you may wish to forego a heroic journey entirely in favor of colonizing uncharted planets.\r\n\r\nSettle down and farm the land, become an intergalactic landlord, hop from planet to planet collecting rare creatures, or delve into dangerous dungeons and lay claim to extraordinary treasures.\r\n\r\nDiscover ancient temples and modern metropolises, trees with eyes and mischievous penguins.
