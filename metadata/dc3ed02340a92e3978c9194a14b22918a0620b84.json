  "description": "Search and Destroy is a freeware program everybody should have.\nIt will scan your PC for those bad spywares.\nAnd so you can destroy them and make your computer cleaan.\nYou may be surprised by the result found.\n\n&quot;Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy detects and removes spyware, a relatively new kind of threat not yet covered by common anti-virus applications. Spyware silently tracks your surfing behaviour to create a marketing profile for you that is transmitted without your knowledge to the compilers and sold to advertising companies. If you see new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you haven't intentionally installed, if your browser crashes inexplicably, or if your home page has been &quot;hijacked&quot; (or changed without your knowledge), your computer is most probably infected with spyware. Even if you don't see the symptoms, your computer may be infected, because more and more spyware is emerging. Spybot-S&amp;D is free, so there's no harm giving it a try to see if something has invaded your computer.&quot;",
