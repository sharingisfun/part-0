  "description": "How I Met Your Mother is an American sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 19, 2005, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays.\n\nAs a framing device, the main character, Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor),[1] with narration by Bob Saget, in the year 2030 recounts to his son and daughter the events that led to his meeting their mother, which explains the title and allows for a narration in the past tense. How I Met Your Mother follows Ted alongside his friends Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris).\n\nHow I Met Your Mother has been a critical success, and has received consistently strong ratings throughout its run. It has won five Emmy Awards, including a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot; in 2009, and has also had a large influence on popular culture. In 2011, CBS announced that the series had been renewed for an additional two seasons, making the current count eight.\n\nThe seventh season of the series is scheduled to premiere on September 19, 2011 with 2 back-to-back episodes.\n",
