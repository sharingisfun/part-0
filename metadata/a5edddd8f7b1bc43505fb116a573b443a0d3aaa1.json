Hope you guys enjoy and please help seed.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/the_guild_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/the_guild_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAbout:\n\n Europe, 1400 A.D. - The last crusade, which started 6 years before, ended in a horrible defeat when the crusaders failed to conquer Nikopolis before being reached by the armies of Osmans and Serbs. The dream of conquering Jerusalem is forgotten, and European authorities are well aware that over the coming centuries, they will be submerged into defending themselves against the Osman forces, which have several outposts in Eastern Europe. The Roman Catholic church is in a state of devastating dispute and intrigue, and uprisings are clearly just around the corner.\nThe Guild 2 is a unique mixture of RPG and life simulation in an immerse middle ages scenario. The player and his party become part of history and can even change it in real-time. Go back to the dark middle ages and found a new dynasty. Take care of yourself, because your opponents never sleep. Marry a beautiful wife and make new friends; control your life. Hand down your skills and your descendants will greatly appreciate it.\n\n\n- 4 different character classes with specific abilities and advantages, from honest craftsman to fierce rogue.\n\n- 10 different professions, including alchemist, smith, and rogue.\n\n- Unique mixture of role playing, strategy, and economic elements.",
