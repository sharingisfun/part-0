  "description": "Football is back in Los Angeles this year, and HBO was there to chronicle it Tuesday in the season's first episode of Hard Knocks.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Rams haven't been to the playoffs since the 2004 season, but they will be one of the marquee storylines throughout the 2016 NFL campaign after leaving St. Louisâ€”where they played from 1995-2015â€”for their old home. Fans received an early glimpse at the team's training camp in Irvine, California during Tuesday's Hard Knocks, and there was plenty of football and amusement along the way.\r\n\r\nRuntime: 55:16\r\nResolution: 850x476\r\nFramerate: 29 FPS",
