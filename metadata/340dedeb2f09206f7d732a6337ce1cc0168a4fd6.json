  "description": "The Cyber Effect - A Pioneering Cyberpsychologist Explains How Human Behavior Changes Online (2016) (Epub) Gooner\r\n\r\nPublisher: Spiegel &amp; Grau (23 Aug. 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0812997859\r\nISBN-13: 978-0812997859\r\n\r\nA groundbreaking exploration of how cyberspace is changing the way we think, feel, and behave \r\nMary Aiken is the world s leading expert in forensic cyberpsychology a discipline that combines psychology, criminology, and technology to investigate the intersection where technology and human behavior meet. In this, her first book, Aiken has created a starting point for all future conversations about how the Internet is shaping development and behavior, societal norms and values, children, safety, security, and our perception of the world. Cyberspace is an environment full of surveillance, but who is looking out for us? The Cyber Effect offers a fascinating and chilling look at a future we can still do something about. \r\nDrawing on her own research and extensive experience with law enforcement, Mary Aiken covers a wide range of subjects from the impact of screens on the developing child to the explosion of teen sexting, and the acceleration of compulsive and addictive behaviors online (gaming, shopping, pornography). She examines the escalation of cyberchondria (anxiety produced by self-diagnosing online), cyberstalking, and organized cybercrime in the Deep Web. Aiken provides surprising statistics and incredible-but-true case studies of hidden trends that are shaping our culture and raising troubling questions about where the digital revolution is taking us",
