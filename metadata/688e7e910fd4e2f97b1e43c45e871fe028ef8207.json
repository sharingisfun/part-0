  "description": "Lynda - SOLIDWORKS 2016 Essential Training\r\n\r\nThis Course will be good to the Best for DL within 30 days after has been posed, after that it might not be good DL already, please do me favour to continue seeding to keep this torrent alive.\r\n\r\n5h 43m Beginner Nov 11, 2015   | Uploaded in Jan 5, 2016 by 2boweb\r\n\r\nSubject: CAD \r\nSoftware: SOLIDWORKS \r\nAuthor: Gabriel Corbett \r\n\r\n\r\nThis training course will teach you the essential tools and modeling techniques to design efficiently in SOLIDWORKSâ€”the world's leading CAD software for product design and development. We use the simple but effective &quot;why, what, how&quot; method of teaching, with the end goal of creating manufacturing-ready parts and assemblies.â€¨â€¨Author Gabriel Corbett first shows how to create 2D sketches and use the Extrude and Revolve tools to turn those sketches into 3D parts. Then he shows how to create more complex geometry with sweeps, lofts, and cuts. Then we jump into lessons covering modifier tools such as Fillet, Chamfer, Draft, and Shell. Then you learn how to create uniform standard holes with the Hole Wizard, and use the pattern and mirror features to reuse geometry. Next we combine parts into assemblies and create a moving assembly from parts and subassemblies. Finally, we create accurately annotated drawings, ready to hand off to a manufacturer.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating your first 3D part\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating sketches\r\n\tâ€¢\tModeling with the Extrude and Revolve features\r\n\tâ€¢\tApplying materials, colors, and backgrounds\r\n\tâ€¢\tSketching basic shapes and polygons\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating offset geometry\r\n\tâ€¢\tMoving, copying, and rotating elements \r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with planes, axes, and the coordinate system \r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating smooth and angled corners with fillets and chamfers \r\n\tâ€¢\tAdvanced part modeling with the Loft and Sweep features\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing the Hole Wizard\r\n\tâ€¢\tDesigning with blocks \r\n\tâ€¢\tBuilding assemblies and subassemblies \r\n\tâ€¢\tMating parts\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing design tables\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding parts and assemblies to drawings\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding dimension notations to a drawing \r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////",
