Instead Lane (John Wayne) convinces her to retrieve the gold so she can collect the $50,000 reward offered by the railroad for its return. Lane lines up some old friends to assist him in retrieving the gold for a share of the reward. But the other original train robbers have gathered a gang and will try to get the gold at any cost. As they all journey into Mexico in search of the hidden gold they are followed closely by Ricardo Montalban's character, a Pinkerton agent. After a series of adventures and battles they return to Texas with the gold where there is one final battle. The next day Lane and his men put Mrs. Lowe on a train to return the gold and tell her she can keep the reward for herself and her son. As they are walking past the end of the train they meet the Pinkerton Agent who tells them, as the train is pulling out, that Matt Lowe was never married and that Mrs. Lowe fooled them into helping her get the gold for herself. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS",
