Cells &amp; Bells (07.41)\n\n\nWithin weeks of the release of their acclaimed debut album Someday World, Warp is excited to reveal that the collaboration between Brian Eno and Karl Hyde continues with a second full-length album, High Life, to be released July 1st.\n\nWritten and recorded across a series of recording sessions in April of 2014 (some of which were open to selected media from around the world), none of the music on High Life existed before Someday World was completed! The resulting record, at 6 tracks and 45 minutes, is the clearest\nexpression yet of the 'Reichkuti' (Steve Reich meets Fela Kuti) direction that first brought the Eno Hyde collaboration into being. And as the polyrhythms and melodies build, swirl and syncopate, the album feels truly alive with the energy of this time in the studio.\n\nHigh Life reunites Eno and Hyde with the 20 year old producer/multi-instrumentalist Fred Gibson, previous Eno-collaborator Leo Abrahams on guitar, drummer Chris Vatalaro, and keyboardist Don E. Taken alongside Someday World, it provides a fascinating insight in to how consistent\ninfluences can lead to very different but connected music, and continues to tell the story of two iconic musicians collaborating and exploring together. We look forward to seeing how fans select their own favorites across the two albums.\n\n\n",
