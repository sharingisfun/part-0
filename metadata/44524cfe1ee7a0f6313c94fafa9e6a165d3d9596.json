The band rose to fame in the early 2000s as a leading group in garage rock/post-punk revival. The band consists of Julian Casablancas (lead vocals), Nick Valensi (lead guitar), Albert Hammond, Jr. (rhythm guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass guitar) and Fabrizio Moretti (drums and percussion).\n\nUpon the release of their debut album, Is This It, in 2001, the group was met with much critical acclaim, being hailed by some as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“saviors of rock and roll.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ NME made Is This It their Album of the Year. Since then, the band has maintained a large fan base, notably in the UK, US and Australia. As of 2007, Is This It has sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nThey released their second album Room on Fire in October 2003, to good reviews, but to less success commercially, although it still went gold. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound maintained the StrokesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ familiar reference points, while also evoking groups such as The Cars, Bob Marley, and Blondie. In the process, they made the cover of Spin Magazine for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of Rolling Stone for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress Drew Barrymore, which ended in January 2007.\n\nAlbums:\n\n2001 Is This It\n2001 The Modern Age\n2002 Hard to Explain\n2003 Room on Fire\n2006 First Impressions of Earth\n2011 Angles\n2013 Comedown Machine\n\nEnjoy.\nGenre:\tRock\nSubgenre:\tIndie / Alternative\nBitrate:\tLossless\nSize:\t1.43 GB\nFile Name \tSize\n2001 The Modern Age/5 03.
