Initially indifferent to Daisy, he eventually connects to the puppy as they spend the day driving around in his vintage '69 Mustang. He encounters a trio of Russian gang members at a gas station and their leader Iosef (Allen) insists on buying his car, but John refuses to sell and makes a snide remark at Iosef before leaving. The three follow John to his home, break in at night, and attack John, who watches defenselessly as they kill Daisy before stealing his car. The following day, Iosef attempts to have the car modified by Aureilo (Leguizamo), the owner of a chop shop who refuses to take it and hits Iosef when realizing who it belonged to and what Iosef did to steal it. John subsequently visits Aureilo, who tells him Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov (Nyqvist), head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York and John's former employer, before lending him another car. Aureilo, who works with Viggo, is forced to explain what happened to Viggo, who berates Iosef and explains who John Wick is: his best assassin, nicknamed the &quot;Boogeyman&quot;, who, before retiring to care for his dying wife five years prior, helped Viggo gain control of his syndicate by single-handedly eliminating the competition.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d76ae0d6cd6c06884b1f30c46f78d669baba3b","amp;dn":"John+Wick.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d76ae0d6cd6c06884b1f30c46f78d669baba3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,215,106,224,214,205,108,6,136,75,31,48,196,111,120,214,105,186,186,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
