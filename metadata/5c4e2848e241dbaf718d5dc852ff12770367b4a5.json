  "description": "All episodes from the first 4 season + extras. All episodes are DVDRip except Season 4 which is HDTV as the DVD isn't out yet. This is the most complete collection on the internet. Please seed.\n\n\nMad Men is an American dramatic television series created and produced by Matthew Weiner. The episodes are premiered on Sunday evenings on the American cable network AMC and are produced by Lionsgate Television. It premiered on July 19, 2007, and completed its fourth season on October 17, 2010. AMC's current contract with series creator Matthew Weiner entails the production of a fifth season, which will air in 2011. Each season consists of 13 episodes.\n\nMad Men is set in the 1960s, initially at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue in New York City, and later at the newly created firm of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. The focal point of the series is Don Draper (Jon Hamm), creative director at Sterling Cooper and a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, as well as those in his life, both in and out of the office. As such, it regularly depicts the changing moods, social mores, and political correctness of 1960s America.\n\nMad Men has received critical acclaim, particularly for its historical authenticity and visual style, and has won multiple awards, including thirteen Emmys and four Golden Globes. It is the first basic cable series to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning it in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n\nIn 2000, while working as a staff writer for Becker, Matthew Weiner wrote the first draft for the pilot of what would later be called Mad Men as a spec script. Television producer David Chase recruited Weiner to work as a writer on his HBO series The Sopranos after reading the pilot script in 2002. &quot;It was lively, and it had something new to say,&quot; Chase said. &quot;Here was someone [Weiner] who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism.&quot;Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ during which time neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½until The Sopranos was completing its final season and cable network AMC happened to be in the market for new programming. &quot;The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series,&quot; according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll &quot;and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal.&quot;\n\nEnjoy.\n",
