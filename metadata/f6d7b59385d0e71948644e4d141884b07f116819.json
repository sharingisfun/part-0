Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining.\n\nThe game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries.\n\nMedieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as an action game too. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Medieval Engineers shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.\n\nMedieval Engineers is the second Ã¢â‚¬Å“engineeringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ game developed by Keen Software House. The first one is Space Engineers, which sold over 1 million copies in its first year and is still a bestseller.\nEarly Access\n\n Game modes\n - Creative - unlimited resources, instant building, invulnerability, levitation\n - Survival - this mode is work-in-progress and only death/respawn has been implemented\n Single-player\n Multi-player Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will be added in a future update\n Barbarians - first prototype of enemy AI\n First-person &amp; Third-person\n Voxel hand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shape the terrain and its material (right now only creative mode voxel hand is implemented)\n Block types:\n - Small: 0.25 meter (25 centimeters)\n - Large: 2.5 meters\n - Dynamic: can be used to construct carriages and machinery that is supposed to be moved around\n - Static: immovable and connected to earth; if a heavy load breaks its structural integrity it cracks and unsupported parts become dynamic\n Building blocks: stone walls (various shapes - from blocky to rounded), wooden walls and flooring, roofs (ceramic, thatched, hay), power source blocks (manual human labor), stored energy blocks (torsion spring), leverages, weights, swings, ropes, wooden beams of various length and shapeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ More will be added in future!\n Realistic physics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ structural integrity, destructible objects (everything: from blocks to terrain), real proportions, volume, mass, storage capacity, integrity\n Steam Workshop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ share your creations with the Community\n Modding - world files, 3D models, textures, shaders, API (scripting in-game objects in C#)\n 32-bit &amp; 64-bit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 64-bit version expands the amount of objects and blocks (almost unlimited) and terrain\n World management Ã¢â‚¬â€œ generate new worlds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“save asÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to multiple copies, auto-save every 5 minutes (can be turned on/off), edit world settings\n\n NOT IMPLEMENTED YET\n\n Mechanical blocks: rotors, transmissions, transitions\n Wind power source block\n Building blocks: torches and other sources of artificial light, flags... More will be added in the future!\n\n\n\nUpdate 02.014\nFeatures:\n- advanced battlement, platforms (big radius)\n- new roof piece\n\nNew blocks:\n- RoofTileLargeRound\n- StonePlatformRoundLarge\n- StoneBattlementRoundLargeCenter\n\nFixes:\n- fixed cannot step onto wooden floor from spiral stairs\n- fixed particle effects LODs missing (major source of a slowdown)\n- fixed few crashes here and there\n\n\nMy personal Fixes:\n- lite fix russian translation in settings\n\n\n\nJust setup and play. \nby Simple Setup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6d7b59385d0e71948644e4d141884b07f116819","amp;dn":"Medieval+Engineers+v02.014.002+%5BMulti9Installer%5D%5BSimpleSetup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6d7b59385d0e71948644e4d141884b07f116819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,215,181,147,133,208,231,25,72,100,78,77,20,24,132,176,127,17,104,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
