You can not buy this edition in stores or online. I have compiled it myself. This collection includes the original deluxe version of the album. It also includes a live version of 'Lies' with a new verse, American bonus track 'How to be a Heartbreaker', 3 more tracks released after the album including a collaboration with Charli XCX and the elusive title track. And for the really big fans, a demo version of 'Miss Y'. I've slightly reordered the tracklist and attached a fan made album cover. The whole album is properly tagged for easy sorting.Enjoy =]\n\nPlease, please, please SEED!!! And if you love the album/artist, then please buy and support =]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c292509544b644fa58d2db9940e4f676bac5d78","amp;dn":"Marina+and+the+Diamonds+-+Electra+Heart+%28Complete%29+%282013+Album%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c292509544b644fa58d2db9940e4f676bac5d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,41,37,9,84,75,100,79,165,141,45,185,148,14,79,103,107,172,93,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
