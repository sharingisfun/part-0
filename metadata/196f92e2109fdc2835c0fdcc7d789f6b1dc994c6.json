Gascoigne rose from poverty-stricken beginnings in North-East England to forge a stellar career with a ferocious free kick and the ability to dribble past entire teams. The film is not only a sports biographical documentary, but also a &quot;compelling narrative-driven character study and cinematic portrayal of infamy.&quot; \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196f92e2109fdc2835c0fdcc7d789f6b1dc994c6","amp;dn":"Gascoigne+%282015%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196f92e2109fdc2835c0fdcc7d789f6b1dc994c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,111,146,226,16,159,220,40,53,192,253,204,125,120,159,107,29,201,148,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
