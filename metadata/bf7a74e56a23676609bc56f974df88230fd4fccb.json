The band took its name from Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, the title of which was a reference to a William Blake quotation: &quot;When the doors of perception are cleansed, things will appear to man as they truly are...infinite.&quot; They were among the most controversial rock acts of the 1960s, due mostly to Morrison's wild, poetic lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until finally disbanding in 1973.\nAlthough The Doors' active career ended in 1973, their popularity has persisted. According to the RIAA, they have sold over 32.5 million albums in the US alone. The band has sold 90 million albums worldwide. Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger continue to tour as Manzarek-Krieger, performing Doors songs exclusively. Three of the band's studio albums, The Doors (1967), L.A. Woman (1971) and Strange Days (1967), were featured in the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at positions 42, 362 and 407 respectively. In 1993, The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n.: The Door Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/5613/1967strangedaysenvelope.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/5613/1967strangedaysenvelope.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1 Studio albums\n1967 Strange Days (40th Anniversary Boxed Set) @320\n1967 The Doors (40th Anniversary Boxed Set) @320\n1968 Waiting For The Sun (40th Anniversary Boxed Set) @320\n1969 The Soft Parade (40th Anniversary Boxed Set) @320\n1970 Morrison Hotel - Hard Rock Cafe (40th Anniversary Boxed Set) @320\n1971 LA Woman (40th Anniversary Boxed Set) @320\n1971 Other Voices @320\n1972 Full Circle @320\n1978 An American Prayer @320\n2007 Infected Mushroom Presents - The Doors Remixed (2 CD) @320\n\n2 Live albums\n1967 (Mar 7th) The Complete Matrix Club Tapes (4 CD) @320\n1968 (Jul 12th) Live in Seattle Center Arena @320\n1968 (Jul 5th) Live at Hollywood Bowl The Riot Show @320\n1968 (Jul 5th) Live at The Hollywood Bowl + Spot Radio Promo (1987) @320\n1968 (Jul 9th) Dallas Memorial Auditorium @320\n1968 (Mar 7th) New York, Steve Paul's scene (Jimi Hendrix ft.
