  "description": "This is an old but golden and fully fuctional edition of Nero Burning Rom. \nSteps: \nFirst Install The trial version , and then look for the serial number in the folder in which is located (the only working serial). After Installing do not run the program but head to the following folder:\nC:Program FilesCommon FilesNeroSharedNL3 and DELETE the file &quot;NeroPatentActivation&quot;\nThis will remove the activation status and make it the real thing. That worked for me in many pc's that I installed it. This torrent is for anybody wants a good version of Nero for burning cd's and Dvd's (it doesn't support Bluray as it is an older version) \nEnjoy!",
