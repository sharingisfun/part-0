  "description": "It is quite obviously a Good Thing that the centre of gravity of young British guitar music seems to be shifting. Where 18 months ago there was a new &quot;landfill indie&quot; album every other week, now it's new, young British folk-pop groups offering debut albums with metronomic regularity. Mumford &amp; Sons spring from the same agglomeration of musicians that has already bequeathed us Laura Marling and Noah and the Whale, and are by all accounts a delightfully rowdy and passionate live band. Why, then, does their album feel just a little bit too polite? Even when the songs - as they invariably do - cut loose into the hoedown section, with bluegrass banjo underpinning acoustic guitars, strings and horns, there's the sense they are holding back. Maybe that's also what causes Sigh No More to sound a little generic: though everything here is pleasing, there's no single &quot;Wow!&quot; moment. Still, it's a promising start, and once Marcus Mumford develops the storytelling skills of US counterparts such as the Low Anthem, there will surely be better to come.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n1:  Sigh No More  \n2:  Cave \t\n3:  Winter Winds \t \n4:  Roll Away Your Stone \t\n5:  White Blank Page \n6:  I Gave You All \n7:  Little Lion Man \n8:  Timshel \n9:  Thistle &amp; Weeds \n10: Awaky My Soul \n11: Dust Bowl Dance \t\n12: After the Storm\n\nSeed and enjoy!!!\n\n",
