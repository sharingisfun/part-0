Guitarist Eddie Van Halen redefined what the electric guitar could do, developing a blindingly fast technique with a variety of self-taught two-handed tapping, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and effects that mimicked the sounds of machines and animals. It was wildly inventive and over the top, equaled only by vocalist David Lee Roth, who brought the role of a metal singer to near-performance art standards. Roth wasn't blessed with great technique, unlike Eddie, but he had a flair for showmanship derived as much from lounge performers as Robert Plant. Together, they made Van Halen into the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the late '70s and early '80s, and in the process set the template for hard rock and heavy metal for the '80s. \n\nFormat:\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Runnin' With The Devil (2015 Remastered)\n02.Eruption (2015 Remastered)\n03.You Really Got Me (2015 Remastered)\n04.Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love (2015 Remastered)\n05.I'm The One (2015 Remastered)\n06.Jamie's Cryin' (2015 Remastered)\n07.Atomic Punk (2015 Remastered)\n08.Feel Your Love Tonight (2015 Remastered)\n09.Little Dreamer (2015 Remastered)\n10.Ice Cream Man (2015 Remastered)\n11.On Fire (2015 Remastered)\n\nCD2\n\n01.You're No Good (2015 Remastered)\n02.Dance The Night Away (2015 Remastered)\n03.Somebody Get Me A Doctor (2015 Remastered)\n04.Bottoms Up!
