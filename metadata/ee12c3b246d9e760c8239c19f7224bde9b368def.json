It is the latest addition in the series of official Ã¢â‚¬Å“bootlegÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recordings issued by Columbia Records.\n\nThe basement recordings were made during 1967, after Dylan had withdrawn to his Woodstock home in the aftermath of a motorcycle accident on July 29, 1966. Dylan has referred to commercial pressures behind the basement recordings in a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone: Ã¢â‚¬Å“They werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t demos for myself, they were demos of the songs. I was being PUSHED again into coming up with some songs. You know how those things go.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In October 1967, a fourteen-song demo tape was copyrighted and the compositions were registered with Dwarf Music, a publishing company jointly owned by Dylan and his manager Albert Grossman. Acetates and tapes of the songs then circulated among interested recording artists.\n\n\n\nPeter, Paul and Mary had the first hit with a basement composition when their cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Too Much of NothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reached number 35 on the Billboard chart in late 1967. Ian &amp; Sylvia, also managed by Grossman, recorded Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tears of RageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Quinn the EskimoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“This WheelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. In January 1968, Manfred Mann reached number one on the UK pop chart with their recording of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Mighty QuinnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.[9] In April, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This WheelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, recorded by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity, hit number five on the UK chart. That same month, a version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“You AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ NowhereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by the Byrds was issued as a single. Along with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nothing Was DeliveredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, it appeared on their country-rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo, released in August.[12] The Hawks, officially renamed the Band, recorded Ã¢â‚¬Å“This WheelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Shall Be ReleasedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tears of RageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for their debut album, Music from Big Pink, released in July 1968. Fairport Convention covered Ã¢â‚¬Å“Million Dollar BashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on their 1969 album Unhalfbricking.\n\n\n\nIn July 1969, the first rock bootleg appeared in California, entitled Great White Wonder. The double album consisted of seven songs from the Woodstock basement sessions, plus some early recordings Dylan had made in Minneapolis in December 1961 and one track recorded from The Johnny Cash Show. One of those responsible for the bootleg, identified only as Patrick, talked to Rolling Stone: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dylan is a heavy talent and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got all those songs nobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever heard. We thought weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d take it upon ourselves to make this music available.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The process of bootlegging DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work would eventually see the illegal release of hundreds of live and studio recordings, and lead the Recording Industry Association of America to describe Dylan as the most bootlegged artist in the history of the music industry.\n\n\n\nThe basement recordings became the basis for DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1975 official release The Basement Tapes. This album was criticised by authors Greil Marcus and Michael Gray because it contained recordings by the Band on their own, and because some important Dylan songs were omitted from the selection\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]",
