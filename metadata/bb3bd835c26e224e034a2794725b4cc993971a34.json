  "description": "\\'The Ricky Gervais Show\\' audiobooks have been developed into an animated TV series, which premiered on 19 February 2010, on the American channel HBO and on the British channel, Channel 4 on Friday 23 April 2010. In Australia, series one first aired in full on Pay Television through Showcase and later moved to Free-To-Air channel, SBS One on 6 November 2010 (but later dropped from the schedule after four episodes).\n\nThe show consists of past audiobooks with animation, drawn in a style similar to classic era Hanna-Barbera cartoons, describing jokes in a literal context.\n\nThe complete Series 1 run of 13 episodes was released on Region 2 DVD on 19 July 2010. In October 2010, it was announced that the series would see a Region 1 (North American) DVD release on 4 January 2011.\n\nThe second season started airing on 14 January 2011.\n",
