  "description": "Windows 7 Activator RemoveWAT v2.2.5.2 by Hazar\n\n\nThis is the latest version downloaded from Hazar's Forum. All credits go to him...\n\n\nHazar's comment:\n\n\nWORKS ON ALL EDITIONS OF 7/R2!\n\nNOT FOR VISTA/ORIGINAL SERVER 2008!!!!\n\nIMPROVEMENTS SINCE 1.0:\nrenames slmgr on x64 aswell\nWorks on unicode systems\nsilent mode with /s switch\nUI tweaked slightly\nNo reboot\nneccessary\nPasses WGA on X64\n\n\nThis is a little tool I put together to remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining genuine status and receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender.\nThere will be no windows activation section in control panel (thanks to nononsence)\n\nno slmgr\n\nno nags, no prompts, nothing. WAT gone.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES/INSTRUCTIONS IN ARCHIVE!\n\n\nIn theory this should have a 100% success rate on all machines.\n\n/s switch is for silent mode \n\n\n\nOriginal Post and link here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/10895-RemoveWAT-A-safer-activation-solution.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/10895-RemoveWAT-A-safer-activation-solution.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n",
