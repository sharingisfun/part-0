Their task is a difficult one: they cannot interfere violently and in no case can they kill. The scientist Rumata tries to save the local intellectuals from their punishment and cannot avoid taking a position. As if the question were: what would you do in God's place? Director's statement Aleksei wanted to make this film his entire life. The road was a long one. This is not a film about cruelty, but about love. A love that was there, tangible, alive, and that resisted through the hardest of conditions.\n\n\n=== Screens === &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/WzbNV6bq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/WzbNV6bq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/o8Vieb8G&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/o8Vieb8G&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/6Bs6wozT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/6Bs6wozT&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===========================\n\nI am not new to torrenting, but this is my first movie torrent, so bare with me. I tried to follow proper formatting as to the description, but I am admittedly somewhat of a noob when it comes to this. I plan on uploading many other Avant-Garde rarities that aren't already available here. I know how hard it can be to find these things.\n\nPlease bring up any issues and make recommendations on how to improve future uploads in the comments",
