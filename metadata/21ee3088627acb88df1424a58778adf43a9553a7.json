  "description": "Jay-Z\nDiscography (1996-2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nEmbodying the rags-to-riches rap dream, Jay-Z pulled himself up by his bootstraps as a youth to eventually become the reigning rapper of New York City and, in turn, a major-label executive following his short-lived retirement from music-making. In the wake of his 1996 debut, Reasonable Doubt, Jay-Z's albums sold millions upon millions with each release, and his endless parade of hits made him omnipresent on urban radio and video television. He retained a strongly devoted fan base and challenged whatever rivals attempted to oust him from atop the rap game, sparring most memorably with Nas. Jay-Z and his Roc-a-Fella associates greatly influenced the industry and established many of the trends that pervaded during the late '90s and early 2000s. He consistently worked with the hottest producers of the day (Clark Kent, DJ Premier, Teddy Riley, Trackmasters, Erick Sermon, Timbaland, Swizz Beatz), and if they weren't hot at the time, they likely would be afterward (the Neptunes, Kanye West, Just Blaze, 9th Wonder). He similarly collaborated with the hottest rappers in the industry, everyone from East Coast contemporaries like the Notorious B.I.G. (&quot;Brooklyn's Finest&quot;) and DMX (&quot;Cash, Money, Hoes&quot;), to the best rappers from the South (Ludacris, Missy Elliott) and the West Coast (Snoop Dogg, Too Short). After his self-declared retirement from rapping in 2003, he assumed the presidency of the seminal rap label Def Jam and, as an industry executive, embarked on another phase in his illustrious career.\n\n\nArtist...............: Jay-Z\nAlbum................: Discography\nGenre................: Rap\nSource...............: CD's\nYear.................: (1996-2013)\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20071117\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: No Logs for:\n                       (2001) Unplugged\n                       (2013) Magna Carta...Holy Grail\n                       \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 3/21/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, LOG, CUE, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Discography Listing\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1996 Jay-Z - Reasonable Doubt\n\n1997 Jay-Z - In My Lifetime, Vol. 1\n\n1998 Jay-Z - Vol. 2...Hard Knock Life\n\n1999 Jay-Z - Vol. 3...
