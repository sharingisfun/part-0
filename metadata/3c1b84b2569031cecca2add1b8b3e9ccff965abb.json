  "description": "The Great Betrayal: The Great Siege of Constantinople - Ernle Bradford [epub]\r\n\r\nFew historians immersed themselves in their topics like bestselling, noted author Ernle Bradford. Specializing in the Mediterranean world and naval topics, Bradford was an enthusiastic sailor himself and spent almost thirty years sailing the Mediterranean, where many of his acclaimed books are set. He served in the Royal Navy during World War II, finishing as the first lieutenant of a destroyer, and afterward worked as an editor and correspondent for the BBC.\r\n\r\nNow, his engaging series of military histories is available to a new generation of readers. Constantinople, jewel of the East, whose Roman emperor embraced Christianity and transformed a fanatic cult into the most powerful religion the world had ever known. The city became itself a center of art, culture, and commerce and the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Yet, when the forces of Islam swept the Holy Land and captured Jerusalem, the avenging Christian crusaders set their eyes on Constantinople, attacked, and sacked it. The war pitted Christian against Christian, severing Romeâ€™s Eastern capital from its Western one. The Fourth Crusade spelled the decline and ultimate doom of the Holy Roman Empire. In The Great Betrayal, Bradford brings to life this powerful tale of envy, greed, and betrayal",
