It describes natural, non-invasive avenues into the brain provided by the forms of energy around usâ€”light, sound, vibration, movementâ€”which pass through our senses and our bodies to awaken the brainÃ¢Â€â„¢s own healing capacities without producing unpleasant side effects. Doidge explores cases where patients alleviated years of chronic pain or recovered from debilitating strokes or accidents; children on the autistic spectrum or with learning disorders normalizing; symptoms of multiple sclerosis, ParkinsonÃ¢Â€â„¢s disease, and cerebral palsy radically improved, and other near-miracle recoveries. And we learn how to vastly reduce the risk of dementia with simple approaches anyone can use.\r\n\r\nFor centuries it was believed that the brainÃ¢Â€â„¢s complexity prevented recovery from damage or disease. The BrainÃ¢Â€â„¢s Way of Healing shows that this very sophistication is the source of a unique kind of healing. As he did so lucidly in The Brain That Changes Itself, Doidge uses stories to present cutting-edge science with practical real-world applications, and principles that everyone can apply to improve their brainÃ¢Â€â„¢s performance and health","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efb1ede5559b883b24dd65ad86be2e42fb2d4f2c","amp;dn":"The+Brain%27s+Way+of+Healing+%282015%29+by+Norman+Doidge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efb1ede5559b883b24dd65ad86be2e42fb2d4f2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,177,237,229,85,155,136,59,36,221,101,173,134,190,46,66,251,45,79,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
