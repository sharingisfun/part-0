  "description": "Official Web Site: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imagenomic.com/pt.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imagenomic.com/pt.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPortraiture is a Photoshop  plugin that eliminates the tedious manual labor of selective masking and pixel-by- pixel treatments to help you achieve excellence in portrait retouching. It intelligently smoothens and removes imperfections while preserving skin texture and other important portrait details such as hair, eyebrows, eyelashes etc.\n\nPortraiture features a powerful masking tool that enables selective smoothening only in the skin tone areas of the image. What makes PortraitureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s masking tool truly unique is its built-in Auto-Mask feature. It helps you quickly discover most of the skin tone range of the image automatically and, if preferred, you can manually fine-tune it to ensure optimal results, providing unmatched precision and productivity.\n\nFor finer control, you can specify the smoothening degree for different detail sizes and adjust the sharpness, softness, warmth, brightness and contrast.\n\nPortraiture comes with pre-defined presets for one-click effects and, as with all Imagenomic plug-ins, you can capture your own signature workflow in a custom preset tailored to your specific requirements and photographic portfolio.\n\n\nSystem Requirements: \n\nMac OS X 10.5.x/10.6.x (Intel only), 1GB RAM, 100MB HDD, 1280x800 min resolution, Photoshop CS4/CS5\n\n---- PLEASE SEED ----",
