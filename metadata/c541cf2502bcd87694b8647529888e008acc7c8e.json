Despite the potentially dense subject matter, Cialdini approaches it in easy-to-understand terms which you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need a Ph.D. to absorb.\n\nThe book covers six ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œweapons of influenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in turn, doing a deep dive on the variations and nuances within each before examining how to avoid their effects:\n\n1. Reciprocation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ giving a little in order to take more\n2. Commitment and consistency ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ playing off our internal need to be consistent with ourselves\n3. Social proof ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the power of what other people are doing\n4. Liking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ positive associations\n5. Authority ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ amazing what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll do for someone who appears to be in authority\n6. Scarcity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ we want things more when they are few\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c541cf2502bcd87694b8647529888e008acc7c8e","amp;dn":"Influence%3A+The+Psychology+of+Persuasion+%287Summits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c541cf2502bcd87694b8647529888e008acc7c8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,65,207,37,2,188,216,118,148,184,100,117,41,136,142,0,138,204,124,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
