  "description": "Reigns v1.0 (Full) Apk-XpoZ \r\n\r\n| Category: Card | | Requires : Android 3.0 and up | \r\n\r\n\r\nSit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is in this version : \r\n\r\n&gt;Changed icon. Corrected music and SFX sliders not working. \r\n\r\nGame Review: \r\n\r\nSit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom. Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and familyâ€™s dynasty at risk! \r\nEach year of your reign brings another important â€“ seemingly random â€“ request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMore At GooglePlay:-https://play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=com.devolver.reigns \r\n\r\nHigh Quality Movies in Ultra compressed size \r\n\r\n\r\nwithout loss in Quality. \r\n\r\n&amp;&amp;&amp; \r\n\r\nFull Android Games &amp; App. \r\n\r\n\r\nXpoZ.Torrent \r\n\r\n\r\nPlz seed Back &amp; keep alive this torrent. \r\n\r\nIf You Need Seeder any of My torrent, Let me Know. \r\n\r\nI'm always there for Seeding. \r\n\r\nAnd Also If You Liked My Torrent, Plsz Don't Forget to Left FeedBack and Comment. \r\n\r\nMore Uploads &amp; For FeedBack Me..... \r\n\r\n\r\nFollow Me At Google+..........:- https://plus.google.com/+XpoZTorrent",
