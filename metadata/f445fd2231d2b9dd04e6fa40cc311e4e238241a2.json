He is the master who climbs down from the pages of the koan books &amp; answers your questions face to face. If not face to face, you can at least find the answers as recorded in Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, a transcription of juicy excerpts from his lectures. From diverse topics such as transience of the world, sudden enlightenment, &amp; the nuts &amp; bolts of meditation, Suzuki always returns to the idea of beginner's mind, a recognition that our original nature is our true nature. With beginner's mind, we dedicate ourselves to sincere practice, without the thought of gaining anything special. Day to day life becomes our Zen training, &amp; we discover that &quot;to study Buddhism is to study ourselves.&quot; &amp; to know our true selves is to be enlightened.--Brian Bruya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f445fd2231d2b9dd04e6fa40cc311e4e238241a2","amp;dn":"Zen+Mind%2C+Beginner%27s+Mind+%28Informal+Talks+on+Zen+Meditation+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f445fd2231d2b9dd04e6fa40cc311e4e238241a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,69,253,34,49,210,185,221,4,230,250,64,204,49,30,78,35,130,65,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
