  "description": "this is a working crack for crysis on 64bit windows7 or vista systems.\n\ni had loads of trouble trying to get crysis to run smooth on a 64bit \n\nsystem and couldnt find a crack or any fix anywhere and from trying to\n\nfind a fix i realised many people had the same problems with the game \n\nconstantly crashing and crackling distorted sound. after alot of digging \n\naround i found this and it works perfectly.\n\n    install\n    -------\n\njust drag or copy the .exe to your crysis bin64 folder.\n\nits just named crysis so i left the original crysis64.exe in the folder also \n\nand it works fine. i ran the cracked .exe in compatability mode for \n\nvista sp2 and checked the run as administarator box and all is good, no \n\nmore crashing and crackling noises, game runs smooth and alot better fps \n\nthan with the 32bit crack.\n\nworks perfect in -DEVMODE also.\n\nfiles scanned with ESET NOD32, AVG Internet Security 9.0 and Malwarebytes.\n                    -----------------------------------\n\nif anybody's wanting a 64bit crack for crysis warhead, all you do is download \n\nthe version 1.1 hotfix for warhead (just google crysis warhead v1.1 hotfix) or\n \ndownload it from sofpedia. its a 37mb fix that adds the bin64 folder to your \n\ncrysis directory cus the game came without 64bit support. then just download \n\nany warhead crack from on here, it doesn't have to be a v1.1 or a 64bit \n\ncrack, i just used the TDM crack, then take only the paul.dll file and add it to \n\nyour bin64 folder replacing the original paul.dll and run the crysis64.exe and you \n\ngot 64bit cracked warhead.\n\n",
