Amongst them, the highlights are represented by the motion paths and templates alongside the Adobe Content Delivery Network (CDN) option for hosting files.\n\n\n=========\n[Features]:\n=========\n\nPrecise animation:\nAdd motion to graphics and HTML elements with amazing accuracy thanks to the innovative timeline editor in Edge Animate. Edit property-based keyframes and use enhanced easing equations for precise control, or use the Pin tool to help speed up the animation process.\n\nIntuitive interface:\nCreate your designs on a WebKit based stage so your compositions have fidelity across modern browsers. Design with an assortment of familiar styling options and effects to create engaging HTML content.\n\nReusable symbols:\nCreate nested animations with independent timelines and interactive capabilities. Symbols are reusable and can be controlled via exposed APIs and pre-built code snippets.\n\nRich interactive capabilities:\nAdd depth to your work by handling user interaction and playback control. Use a built-in code snippet library, or add your own JavaScript code using the code editor.\n\nNative HTML support:\nOpen existing HTML pages and add motion to individual elements. Edge Animate works natively with HTML, and the animation code is stored in a separate file so the integrity of the page is preserved.\n\nDrawing and text tools:\nBuild compositions from scratch using drawing and text tools, and manipulate objects with an array of transformation and styling options. You can also import a variety of web graphics such as SVG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF files.\n\nPublishing options:\nPublish with options such as emitting HTML markup for SEO friendliness, choosing whether jQuery should be packaged with the project, or adding a preloader to specify what should be shown before the project is downloaded.\n\nResizable layouts:\nCreate compositions that can adapt to different screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones.\n\nWeb fonts:\nAdd richer typography to your compositions by integrating with a web font service such as Typekit.\n\nDigital Publishing support:\nImport Edge Animate compositions into the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite with Adobe InDesign CS6, or into Apple iBooks Author.\n\nDown-level browser support:\nGenerate content that gracefully fails on browsers that don't support the latest web standards. Animations fall back to a static state, which you can define on the down-level stage. Edge Animate also supports Google Chrome Frame for additional compatibility on older browsers.\n\nMobile-ready content:\nContent created with Edge Animate is designed to work reliably on iOS and Android devices, and modern browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer 9.\n\n\n============\n[What's New]:\n============\n\n-Support for HTML5 video\n-Import sprite sheets from Flash Pro, Photoshop or other design tools\n-Linking support for DPS Articles\n-Updated actions editor\n-Copy and paste SVG artwork from Illustrator\n-Hand and Zoom tools\n\n\n====================\n[System Requirements]:\n====================\n\n-IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â® 4 or AMD AthlonÃ‚Â® 64 processor\n-WindowsÃ‚Â® 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 operating system\n-1GB of RAM\n-200MB of available hard-disk space for installation\n-1280x800 display with 16-bit video card\n\n\n===========\n[Languages]:\n===========\n\nDeutsch, English, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, FranÃƒÂ§ais, Italiano, Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¨ÂªÅ¾","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d580539133e0c14a9799d04a508676f8316b6153","amp;dn":"Adobe+Edge+Animate+CC+2014+4.0+Multilanguage+%2B+Crack+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d580539133e0c14a9799d04a508676f8316b6153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,128,83,145,51,224,193,74,151,153,208,74,80,134,118,248,49,107,97,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
