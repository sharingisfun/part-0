  "description": "&quot;Welcome to Game Dev Tycoon, this game was created by Greenheart Games, which was founded with an agenda to make 'fun to play instead of mind numbing money grabbers. Less social, less ville, more game is our motto&quot; \n^ taken from the Gamedevtycoon wikia. (too tired to update it so lets pretend this is 100% accurate and unchanged.)\n\n\n\nInstallation directions:\n\n1. Download\n2. Unrawr (Don't think you even need this step, move on to step 3.  or step 2.5 = read the notes)\n3. Install\n4. Play\n5. If you like it, go buy it!\n\n\nThis is the full game. Contains over 20 language options for install (So yeah... its multilingual)  (and it IS the legit edition, not the 'go bankrupt as the game gets good edition')\n\nDescription:\n\nStart your own game development company and replay the history of gaming in this business simulation game. Start your business in a garage in the 80s. Research new technologies and create best selling games. Hire and train staff. Move into bigger offices and unlock secret labs. Become the leader of the market and gain worldwide fans.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Start your own game Development company in the 80's\n- Design and create your own games\n- Research new technologies\n- Create your own custom game engine\n- Move into bigger offices\n- Forge a world-class development team\n- Unlock secret labs\n- Conduct industry changing products\n- Unlock achievements!\n\n\nOnce more, enjoy the gameplay, I'll update as updates happen..    and Should you like the game, GO BUY IT! (I certainly did)  its only like $9 bucks..\n\nAnd this game goes on sale often enough(Steam, their site) that you can pick it up for as cheap as like.. 2-4 bucks sometimes!\n\nEnjoy the update, apologies for the absence of prior editions",
