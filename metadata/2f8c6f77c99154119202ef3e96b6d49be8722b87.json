  "description": "Starters Guide to Music Theory and Analysis Tonal System (2016) (Pdf) Gooner\r\n\r\nPublisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition (28 Jun. 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1534975918\r\nISBN-13: 978-1534975910\r\n\r\nThis is a step by step guide for music theory and analysis for the beginners. From basics of musical notation to the principles of tonality, all of the difficult subjects of music theory are explained in detail, with demonstrations. The student is prepared for analysis studies step by step. The exercises provided at the end of each chapter (and sometimes extra exercises in the middle of a chapter) are designed for the student to develop what she/he learned by reading and prepare herself/himself for the next challenge. Music theory is generally a scary subject for musicians. This is not true for a person who is capable of developing connections between different aspects of music theory and is able to practice them in a fluid way. That is because the practice holds the analytical secrets inside and the person who opens it is awarded. For most of the students, practicing scales or practicing chords of a scale is something just very very low profile work. The fingers memorize which key on the piano to be pressed in which order when the piano is chosen as the instrument for assistive training, but the brain does not want to develop connections between different aspects of the same theoretical practice such as playing a major scale first, let's say G major, and then playing a different one, let's say A-flat major. The result is a temporary learning of scale practicing, but a possible failure in music theory, since the rules which are just there to see are not exercised at the same time. We observed that a long-term learning is possible by practicing and examining what is practiced to make connections. We searched a way to show these connections in this book. Analysis is another problem in academic education of music",
