One Parasyte attempts to crawl into Shinichi's ear while he sleeps, but fails since\nhe is wearing headphones, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead, taking over his right hand and is named Migi.\nBecause Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from traveling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate\nintellect and personality. As the duo encounter other Parasytes, they capitalize on their strange situation and\ngradually form a strong bond, working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasytes,\nwho frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels\ncompelled to fight other Parasytes, who devour humans as food, while enlisting Migi's help.\n\nIMDB :- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3358020/( Rating : 9.0 )\n\nPlease KEEEEP SEEEDING !!\n\nCheers !!",
