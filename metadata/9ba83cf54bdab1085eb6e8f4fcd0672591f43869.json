His works of fiction and non-fiction have garnered critical acclaim and numerous awards, including the Franz Kafka Prize, the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award and the Jerusalem Prize, among others. Murakami has also translated a number of English works to Japanese. His notable works include 1Q84, Kafka on the Shore, Norwegian Wood, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.\n\nMurakami's fiction, often criticized by Japan's literary establishment, is often humorous and surreal, marked by a Kafkaesque rendition of themes of alienation and loneliness. He is considered an important figure in postmodern literature. The Guardian praised Murakami as &quot;among the world's greatest living novelists&quot; for his works and achievements.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ba83cf54bdab1085eb6e8f4fcd0672591f43869","amp;dn":"Haruki+Murakami+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ba83cf54bdab1085eb6e8f4fcd0672591f43869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,168,60,245,75,218,177,8,94,182,232,244,252,208,103,37,145,244,56,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
