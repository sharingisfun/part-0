  "description": "Noise is a serious problem that complicates digital video processing. Footage coming from digital video cameras, camcorders, digital TV-tuners, film digitizers, etc., often contains an easily noticeable noise component that may distract viewers.\n\nNeat Video is a solution to the noise problem.\nNeat Video is a filter specifically designed to reduce visible noise in digital video clips produced by modern digital video capturing devices as well as digitized from traditional film or VHS records.\n\nThe key features of the Neat Video plug-in for Premiere:\n\n- Advanced Noise Reduction to reduce noise and grain in video clips\n- Both intra-frame and temporal filtration\n- Automatic noise analyzer to adapt the plug-in to any video sources\n- Smart Sharpening to make video sharper without amplification of noise\n- High-bitdepth rendering (in Pro plug-in)\n- CUDA and OpenCL acceleration to speed up processing using computation-capable GPUs\n\nQUALITY OF NOISE REDUCTION provided by Neat Video is higher than that of all other methods because: \n\n- Neat Video incorporates the most advanced noise reduction algorithms in the industry\nNeat Video noise reduction algorithms were developed for digital imaging and digital video processing field by a highly-qualified professional research group. These algorithms surpass the quality of all classic noise reduction methods and even that of the wavelet-based methods. Although the wavelet-based methods were developed only 15-20 years ago and are still considered relatively modern, Neat Video uses an even newer and more efficient approach to noise reduction. This approach allows drawing a more clear distinction between noise and details in noisy video data. This helps Neat Video reduce more noise and better preserve true details in digital video clips.\n\n- Neat Video builds and uses device noise profiles to make noise reduction custom-tailored to video capturing device\nA device noise profile is a reusable analysis of noise properties of a video capturing device (digital video camera, film digitizer, etc.) working in a certain mode. Using a noise profile for a video capturing device in effect makes noise reduction custom-tailored to this device. Neat Video can automatically build noise profiles by analyzing the input video data.\n\nRICH FUNCTIONALITY AND HIGH PERFORMANCE of Neat Video enables both beginners and experienced users to achieve great results easily and quickly\n\n* Neat Video is highly automated\n\n-Adaptive filtration: Neat Video can automatically adjust its filters to changing noise in different parts of video clip\n-Neat Video can build noise profiles either automatically or with your assistance\n-You can rely on default filter settings or manually adjust the filters\n-You can easily save built noise profiles and adjusted filter settings\n\n* Neat Video provides exactly the amount of control required\n\n-Standard mode offers a simplified control set that is very easy to use for new users\n-Advanced mode gives power users the most complete control set to tweak virtually all filter settings\n\n* Neat Video helps to adjust filter setting with efficient visual feedback\n\n-Intra-frame preview embedded directly into the frame viewer shows how the filtration result will look like and lets you visually compare it with the original frame\n-Channel and frequency viewer modes help to identify noisy video components that require special attention by adjusting the filter settings corresponding to these components\n-Variant Selector helps to visually compare the filtration results obtained with several variants of filter settings and select the best variant (in some Win versions)\n\n* Neat Video is efficient\n\n-Neat Video efficiently reduces many noise types typical for digital video cameras, camcorders, TV-tuners, film or analog video digitizers\n-Neat Video v3 renders a 720x576 clip at the speed of 20-30 frames per second when running on Intel i7 3.4 GHz\n-Rendering speed is higher when CUDA acceleration (on NVidia GPUs) or OpenCL acceleration (on supported AMD/ATI GPUs) is available\n\n* Neat Video supports the industry standard video data types and file formats\n\n-standard-bitdepth (8-bit per channel; 24-bit RGB) rendering is supported by all versions of Neat Video\n-high-bitdepth rendering is supported by the Pro versions of Neat Video plug-in for After Effects, Premiere, Final Cut, Motion, AVX, OpenFX hosts\n-Any video file format supported by the plug-in host can be processed with the Neat Video plug-in\nFor example, you can open an AVI, MPEG, WMV, etc., video file in the host application and then directly process it with the Neat Video plug-in\n-Frame sizes supported: up to 1920x1080 and higher; (HD, 2K, 4K, etc.); in Pro edition.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\n64-bit version:\n- Adobe Premiere Pro CC / CS6 / CS5.5 / CS5 for Windows\n- Adobe Premiere Elements 12 (64-bit) /11 (64-bit) / 10 (64-bit)\n- Windows 8 64-bit, Windows 7 64-bit, Vista 64-bit\n- Core 2 class machine or better\n- True color display with 1024x768 resolution or higher\n\n32-bit version:\n- Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 / CS3 / 2 / 1.5 / 1\n- Adobe Premiere Elements 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1\n- Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, XP (32-bit or 64-bit)\n- Pentium-III class machine or better\n- True color display with 1024x768 resolution or higher\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neatvideo.com/overview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neatvideo.com/overview.html&lt;/a&gt;",
