  "description": "Pixies\nWave Of Mutilation\nThe Best Of Pixies (2004)\n\n\nCombining jagged, roaring guitars and stop-start dynamics with melodic pop hooks, intertwining male-female harmonies and evocative, cryptic lyrics, the Pixies were one of the most influential American alternative rock bands of the late '80s. The Pixies weren't accomplished musicians -- Black Francis wailed and bashed out chords while Joey Santiago's lead guitar squealed out spirals of noise. But the bandmembers were inventive, rabid rock fans who turned conventions inside out, melding punk and indie guitar rock, classic pop, surf rock, and stadium-sized riffs with singer/guitarist Black Francis' bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture; while the meaning of his lyrics may have been impenetrable, the music was direct and forceful. \n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Bone Machine\n02.Nimrod's Son\n03.The Holiday Song\n04.Caribou\n05.Broken Face\n06.Gigantic (Single Version)\n07.Vamos (Surfer Rosa)\n08.Hey\n09.Monkey Gone To Heaven\n10.Debaser\n11.Gouge Away\n12.Wave Of Mutilation\n13.Here Comes Your Man\n14.Tame\n15.Where Is My Mind\n16.Into The White\n17.Velouria\n18.Allison\n19.Dig For Fire\n20.U-Mass\n21.Alec Eiffel\n22.Planet Of Sound\n23.Winterlong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n",
