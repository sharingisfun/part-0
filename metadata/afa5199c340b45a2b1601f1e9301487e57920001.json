His highly controversial experiments have made him famous, but they have also made him the prime target of anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed-to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should. Their worst fears are realized as Will's thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown. The only thing that is becoming terrifyingly clear is there may be no way to stop him.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bc419a3d16c.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bc419a3d16c.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bc419a6b940.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bc419a6b940.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bc419a98aea.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53bc419a98aea.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa5199c340b45a2b1601f1e9301487e57920001","amp;dn":"Transcendence+%282014%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa5199c340b45a2b1601f1e9301487e57920001","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,165,25,156,52,11,69,162,177,96,31,30,147,1,72,126,87,146,0,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
