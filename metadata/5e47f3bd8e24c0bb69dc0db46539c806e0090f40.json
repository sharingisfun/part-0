When the Americans are given \r\nphotographs of it, they are extremely curious as to why is it so special. \r\nJack Ryan, a CIA analyst, consults with a friend, who deduces that it's \r\nequipped with a new engine that can make it run virtually silent and with \r\nsuch a device, they can position themselves on the outskirts of any coastal \r\ncity and launch their missles and not give their target any warning. Marko \r\nRamius the sub's captain kills their political officer after they open their \r\norders which basically has them conducting routine maneuvers but he kills him \r\nand burns their orders and replaces it. He then tells the crew that they are \r\ngoing to test their new engine by positioning themselves by New York and run \r\nmissile drills. Ryan is then called by his boss to attend a briefing that \r\nconcerns Red October. It is at this briefing that they discover that Ramius \r\nsent a letter to high ranking Soviet official, who after reading the letter \r\nwent to meet with the Soviet Premier and it was shortly after that meeting \r\nthat the Soviet navy was deployed to find Red October and sink it. Everyone \r\nassumes that Ramius has turned rogue but Ryan who once did research on Ramius \r\nassumes that he might be trying to defect. While everyone dismisses him, the \r\nNational Security Adviser tells Ryan to go out there and find out for sure \r\nif he is right cause once Ramius is in position to fire his missiles they \r\nhave take him out. Ryan reluctantly goes and is not use to fieldwork, is \r\nhaving a hard time coping with the sea. At the same time someone in the Red \r\nOctober crew knows that Ramius has deviated from his assignment and is \r\ndoing what he can to stop him.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Sean Connery.\r\n=&gt;-Alec Baldwin.\r\n=&gt;-Scott Glenn.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-John McTiernan.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Adventure : Thriller.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1990.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.05 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 175 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 15mn.\r\n=&gt;-The Hunt For Red October...: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hunt_for_red_october/\r\n=&gt;-The Hunt For Red October...: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hunt-for-red-october-1990/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1 920 x 816.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 010 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 160 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 255 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e47f3bd8e24c0bb69dc0db46539c806e0090f40","amp;dn":"The+Hunt+For+Red+October+-+Sean+Connery+Thriller+1990+Eng+Subs+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e47f3bd8e24c0bb69dc0db46539c806e0090f40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,71,243,189,142,36,192,187,105,220,13,180,101,57,200,6,224,9,15,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
