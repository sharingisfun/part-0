  "description": "A Guide to Hubble Space Telescope Objects - Their Selection, Location, and Significance (2nd Ed)\nby James L. Chen and Adam Chen\nSpringer | July 2015 | ISBN-10: 3319188712 | PDF | 244 pages | 15.5 mb\n\nFrom the authors of &quot;How to Find the Apollo Landing Sites,&quot; this is a guide to connecting the view above with the history of recent scientific discoveries from the Hubble Space Telescope. Each selected HST photo is shown with a sky map and a photograph or drawing to illustrate where to find it and how it should appear from a backyard telescope. Here is the casual observer's chance to locate the deep space objects visually, and appreciate the historic Hubble photos in comparison to what is visible from a backyard telescope. HST objects of all types are addressed, from Messier objects, Caldwell objects, and NGC objects, and are arranged in terms of what can be seen during the seasons. Additionally, the reader is given an historical perspective on the work of Edwin Hubble, while locating and viewing the deep space objects that changed astronomy forever.\nCountless people have seen the amazing photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. But how many people can actually point out where in the sky those objects are? Why were these objects chosen to be studied? What discoveries were made from the Hubble Space Telescope photographs? This book is for anyone who wants answers to these questions. \n\nAbout the Author\nAuthor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ James Chen: Retired Department of the Navy and Federal Aviation Administration Radar and Surveillance Systems Engineer.
