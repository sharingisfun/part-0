  "description": "&quot;This series is about how those in power have used Freud's theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy.&quot; -- Adam Curtis\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed the perception of the human mind and its workings profoundly. His influence on the 20th century is widely regarded as massive. The documentary describes the impact of Freud's theories on the perception of the human mind, and the ways public relations agencies and politicians have used this during the last 100 years for their &quot;engineering of consent&quot;.\n\nAmong the main characters are Freud himself and his nephew Edward Bernays, who was the first to use psychological techniques in advertising. He is often seen as the &quot;father of the public relations industry&quot;. Freud's daughter Anna Freud, a pioneer of child psychology, is mentioned in the second part, as well as Wilhelm Reich, one of the main opponents of Freud's theories.\n\nAlong these general themes, The Century of the Self asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of modern consumerism, representative democracy and its implications. It also questions the modern way we see ourselves, the attitude to fashion and superficiality.\n[..]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/century_of_the_self.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/century_of_the_self.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_Of_The_Self\n\n\nTV rip, video quality is ok.\nDivX video, mp3 audio, resolution 480x368.",
