Download last version of cracks posted here.\nThere will be two crack type in .rar\n3DM crack - Crack for SinglePlayer and for activating all DLCs (only what DLC you put in dlc folder)\nSteamworks Fix-RVTFiX or SteamFix - Crack for SinglePlayer and Multiplayer over Steam, but can't activate alone DLCs\n3DM cracked steam_api.dll is flagged as virus - it is not a virus. Give exclusion to antivirus or disable antivirus. Id you don't do that antivirus will delete that file and game will always crash at start.\n\n02. To activate all DLCs we need to crack the game with 3DM crack.\nPut 2 files (3DMGAME.ini and steam_api.dll in the game folder)\nDon't remember for antivirus\nNow start the game and game will generate dlc_signature with all DLC\nNow you can leave the game.\n\n03. If you want to play just SinglePlayer then you don't need other part of instruction and second crack.\n\n04. To play game Multiplayer via Steam (only with other user who use the same Crack), you need to crack game with SteamFix\nPut all 3 files from SteamFix folder in to game folder (REVOLT.dll, REVOLT.ini, steam_api.dll)\nStart Steam and go to settings in steam launcher\nGo to Downloads tab in settings and then go to Download Region and put to UK - London (this is general area for all our users)\nNow Start the game with game .exe. Now game will start normally and with Steam function and all DLCs\nNow have fun and spread happiness to the world...\nLive long and have a nice gaming life.  :ugeek",
