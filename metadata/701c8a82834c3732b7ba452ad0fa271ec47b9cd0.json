  "description": "\n\n\n\n\nIn This Moment hails from USAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Los Angeles and has been founded by Maria Brink and Chris Howorth in 2005. Ã¢â‚¬ËœBloodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is their fourth studio album. The album has that Modern Metal feel with its pop-leaning melodies, with a bit of Metalcore thrown into mix, with some interesting Ã¢â‚¬ËœspicesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as guitar solo with a twist in Ã¢â‚¬ËœBloodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, where there is also a weird feeling regarding its closeness with rap though at the same time it's still not really anywhere near in its vicinity, a ferocious track with some acerbic wit, and a song that has been taken out as a single, unsurprisingly. Ã¢â‚¬ËœAdrenalizeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is great though nothing unexpected, a crowd-pleaser. Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has some great electronically introduced atmosphere, catchy hook that gets under your skin. Some tracks do feel out of way here as Ã¢â‚¬ËœIt Is WrittenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with their sample based Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s introduce some ambience here&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which seems to derail the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy rather than supplement it.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœFrom The AshesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ had some cringy moments towards the end Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you just know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for the audience to join in during the live gigs, as rather than spontaneous it feels calculated. Ã¢â‚¬ËœComancheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has an unbridled aggression and Industrial strip-down feel with some of a most unique flavour to be found here, the most interesting song and best moment of the album for me. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Blood LegionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brings in some of aching beauty that can be found in melancholy. Closing Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ11:11Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ is rescued from melodrama by a little sense of theatricality. It belongs to the category of albums that grow on you with each listen. Though sometimes there are traces of generic-driven music, the prevailing sense is that they have enough of their own flavour to be able to be differentiated, albeit the generic leaning means it loses some power in the kick to the viscera. However, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll end up enjoying regardless.\n\n2014 Black Widow\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;The Infection&quot; 1:49\n2. &quot;Sex Metal Barbie&quot; 4:22\n3. &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; 5:12\n4. &quot;Dirty Pretty&quot; 4:07\n5. &quot;Black Widow&quot; 4:58\n6. &quot;Sexual Hallucination (Feat.
