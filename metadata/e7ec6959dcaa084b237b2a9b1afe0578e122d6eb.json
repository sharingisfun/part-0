Or cyberghosted, like we use to say.\n\n\nFREEDOM:\n\nOnce ghosted, you can roam the Internet freely and uncensored, \nvisit geo restricted web sites, watch blocked videos and \ninvestigate all topics of interest unhindered from your government, your school, \nyour university or your employee. \n\nA simple example: If a content item, like a music video clip, is not available in \nyour country, just log-in to one of our outside-your-country servers \nand virtually become an inhabitant of the respective nation. It's just as easy as that.\n\n\n\nSECURITY:\n\nCyberGhost VPN not just only anonymizes you. It encodes all data leaving \nyour computer as well. \n\nYou can look at your connection between you and the CyberGhost network as a tunnel \nwith unbreakable solid walls, which hides all your data from spying eyes on public WLANs, \nHot Spots and Internet cafes. \nAnd CyberGhost does not only concentrate on your browser: all Internet applications \nwill be secured this way. It's nearly like walking invisible through Central Park \nat midnight, with your wallet wide open, and nothing will harm you. Cause nobody sees you!\n\n\n\n\nCYBER-GHOST HELPS:\n\n\nTo protect your privacy on the Internet and hinder site operators from tracking you down \nand clearly identifying you.\n\nTo get access to uncensored websites outside your country, outside your office or \noutside your school resp. your university network.\n\nTo get access to blocked websites or blocked content by circumventing geo, IP or \nother blockades.
