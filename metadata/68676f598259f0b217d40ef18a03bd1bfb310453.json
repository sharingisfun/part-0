  "description": "Lazaretto is the second solo album by Jack White. It was released on June 10, 2014 through White's own label Third Man Records in association with XL Recordings and Columbia Records. The limited-edition &quot;Ultra&quot; LP features hidden songs, secret grooves, and holograms that materialize when the record is being played. Lazaretto was partly inspired by a collection of short stories, poems, and plays White wrote when he was 19 years old and rediscovered years later in his attic.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Three Women&quot;   \t3:57\n02. \t&quot;Lazaretto&quot;   \t3:39\n03. \t&quot;Temporary Ground&quot;   \t3:13\n04. \t&quot;Would You Fight for My Love?&quot;   \t4:09\n05. \t&quot;High Ball Stepper&quot;   \t3:52\n06. \t&quot;Just One Drink&quot;   \t2:37\n07. \t&quot;Alone in My Home&quot;   \t3:27\n08. \t&quot;Entitlement&quot;   \t4:06\n09. \t&quot;That Black Bat Licorice&quot;   \t3:50\n10. \t&quot;I Think I Found the Culprit&quot;   \t3:49\n11. \t&quot;Want and Able&quot;   \t2:34",
