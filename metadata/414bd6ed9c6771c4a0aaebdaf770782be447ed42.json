Then I realized that this could be used to upgrade language packs to the latest version possible. Unfortunately this can't change the fact that Version 4 language packs are still not available, but at least we can have latest V3 language packs installed.\n\nI got so excited after discovering this that I made this torrent in a rush, with this being a complex project itself. Mistakes may present, so please reply or PM me about these mistakes, and I will try my best to fix them ASAP, because it means a lot to myself; then I will give you feedback on this one. Thank you!\n\nIn addition, I live in China, where the upload speed in most households is intentionally limited to about 250kb/s (2Mbps maybe?). This torrent weights 50G, so the seeding will be very difficult. Although I have tried to find as many computers to seed as possible, but don't expect it to be &quot;fast&quot; at all, given the fact that we may live thousands of miles away and the connection can't reach its destination. So please help me seed if you like it. Thank you for your patience and helpfulness.\n\nP.S. most language packs are inherited from my last torrent on Rosetta Stone V3.4.7, and that torrent has significantly many more seeders. Installation files and cracks can also be downloaded elsewhere. The most important thing you may want from this torrent is the language pack update files which, in total, takes up only 1.58 GB, and the tutorial written by me.\n\nlaozhou100","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:414bd6ed9c6771c4a0aaebdaf770782be447ed42","amp;dn":"Rosetta+Stone+%28Windows+%2B+Mac+OS+V4.5.5%29+%2B+V3+Language+Packs+%2B+V3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"414bd6ed9c6771c4a0aaebdaf770782be447ed42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,75,214,237,156,103,113,196,160,170,235,218,247,112,120,43,228,71,237,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
