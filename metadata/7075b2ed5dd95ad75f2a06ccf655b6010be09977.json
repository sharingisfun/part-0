  "description": "ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE FILMS\n\n\nenjoy\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n\n\n\nTRIVIA FROM IMDB\n\nWhen Ernesto and Alberto are at the Chuquicamata copper mine, the foreman shouts that the mine &quot;isn't a tourist attraction.&quot; These days, it is. \n\n&quot;Al otro lado del rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­o&quot;, by Uruguayan composer Jorge Drexler became the second song in a language other than English to win an Oscar. (The first was &quot;Ta paidia toy Peiraia&quot; (Children of Piraeus) by Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis from the film Never on Sunday). Producers asked Drexler, who wrote and recorded the song for the film, not to perform it during the Oscar ceremony, citing &quot;commercial reasons&quot; (he's not famous). Antonio Banderas and Carlos Santana performed the song instead. When Drexler went to the podium to accept his Oscar, he sang about 30 seconds of the song a capella, instead of giving a speech. \n\nDespite being based upon an Argentinean book, about a Cuban-Argentinean legend, with a Mexican and an Argentinean actor in the leading roles and spoken in Spanish, the film represented Brazil in many film festivals worldwide. Only the director, Walter Salles, is Brazilian. \n\nWhen Ernesto and Alberto are in Temuco, walking with the bike and reading &quot;El Diario Austral,&quot; Alberto complains because they misspelled his last name. El Diario Austral still exists, and it's the biggest newspaper in the AraucanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a region of southern Chile. During filming in Temuco, the newspaper wrote a new article about the making of the film, and deliberately misspelled Alberto's last name again, 50 years later. \n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nThe Motorcycle Diaries 2004 720p HDDVD_sujaidr\n\naka\n\nDiarios de motocicleta (original title)\n\n\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;88c0e1efe0c8c4bba6b9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 5 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 2h 5mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 796 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 688 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.860\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.038\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 2h 5mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\nlanguage                          Spanish mixed with Quechua and Mapudungun\n                      \n\nsubtitle                          english muxed(can be turned off)\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to sun\n\nuploader \n sujaidr\n\n\n\nPLOT: In 1952, twenty-three year old medical student Ernesto Guevara de la Serna - Fuser to his friends and later better known as 'Ernesto Che Guevara' - one semester away from graduation, decides to postpone his last semester to accompany his twenty-nine year old biochemist friend 'Alberto Granado' - Mial to his friends - on his four month, 8,000 km long dream motorcycle trip throughout South America starting from their home in Buenos Aires. Their quest is to see things they've only read about in books about the continent on which they live, and to finish that quest on Alberto's thirtieth birthday on the other side of the continent in the Guajira Peninsula in Venezuela. Not all on this trip goes according to their rough plan due to a broken down motorbike, a continual lack of money (they often stretching the truth to gain the favor of a variety of strangers to help them)...\n\n\nDirector:Walter Salles\nWriters: Ernesto 'Che' Guevara (book), Alberto Granado\nStars:           Gael GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Bernal, Rodrigo De la Serna and Mercedes MorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/jJqbf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/jJqbf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/GlyfX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/GlyfX.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/3JKJs.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/3JKJs.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/6V415.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/6V415.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n                                        TO VISIT MY facebook page to post requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR \n\n\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n",
