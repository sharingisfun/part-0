Already fan favorites in the scene, Pennsylvania sextet Motionless In White is set to rise to the front of the pack, with the release of debut full-length Creatures.\n\nThe tale of Motionless In WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conception begins in 2005. Forming in Scranton, PA while still in high school, six friends Ã¢â‚¬â€œ singer Chris Ã¢â‚¬Å“MotionlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cerulli, guitarist/vocalist TJ Bell, guitarist Ryan Sitkowski, bassist Frank Polumbo, keyboardist Josh Balz, and drummer Angelo Parente - joined forces to form a band, originally playing popular rock cover songs.\n\nBy 2006, they had developed their own sound, blending heavier, darker elements into melodic tracks, and gaining inspiration from the likes of The Misfits, Bleeding Through, Cradle Of Filth, Marilyn Manson and Eighteen Visions to form Motionless In White. With the release of debut EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WhorrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and two summers of wowing crowds with their high-octane show on dates of Vans Warped Tour, the band gained the attention of both independent and major record labels, including Fearless Records. The band signed to Fearless in December 2008, and set about recording their acclaimed second EP When Love Met Destruction, which was released in spring 2009.\n\nNow ready to unleash their debut album Creatures, Motionless In White is poised to take centre stage in their twisted audio carnival. Creatures is a writhing behemoth of an album.\n\nMixing gothic and industrial influences with brutal breakdowns, intense riffs and soaring choruses, the album interweaves themes of lust and revenge with the band's passion for horror movies, myths and vampire culture. From gut-punching opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Immaculate MisconceptionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, to Tim Burton-inspired closing track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scissorhands (The Last Snow)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, every note on Creatures has been explored to create an audio landscape that Motionless In White are thrilled to call their own. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think we did a really good job at making this record interesting in a lot of aspects,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ singer Chris Motionless notes.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“...The last thing I wanted to do was write another bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record and call it ours. We pulled from so many different musical influences, especially with the lyrics. We put everything we had into making this record...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOne of the strongest parts of Motionless In WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success story is their dedication to their fans. The band doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take their followingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dedication lightly. The band named their full-length after their devoted fan base, which they affectionately call Ã¢â‚¬Å“CreaturesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, to remind their supporters that despite their differences, they are bonded by music.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“...I only ever wanted to be in a band because music changed my life so much, and all I wanted to be able to do the same for someone else in my own way...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Chris adds. Ã¢â‚¬Å“To see all these people that are interested in this band and see them singing the words to our songs, like I used to dream would happen while I would be in a pit, screaming along to my favorite bands, is seriously mind-blowing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The band even allowed their Ã¢â‚¬Å“CreaturesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to contribute to the album, creating the title track entirely of fan lyrics. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I really couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think of a better way to say thank you than to have our fans literally be part of this album, and to name our record after the people that are keeping us alive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nimage\nGaining early support from all corners of the media has also been a key element in aiding Motionless In WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ascension through the ranks of the new wave of dark rock bands. The band was named as one of Alternative PressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bands You Need To Know, is one of Revolver MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bands To Watch in the November/December 2010 issue, and has upcoming features in U.S. and international music press outlets including AOL Noisecreep, Ultimate-Guitar, AMP, Substream, Rock Sound and Kerrang!, plus horror publications Rue Morgue, Fangoria, Bloody-Disgusting and FEARnet.\n\nThe band has already toured the U.S. with the likes of Asking Alexandria, Bleeding Through, In This Moment and Drop Dead, Gorgeous, and looks forward to taking their show on the road this fall, including tours with Black Veil Brides and A Skylit Drive. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Expect to see a very honest and passionate performance every day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ notes Chris. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We put a lot of time in trying to make our live show express the intensity and energy that we posses across to the crowd. I've bled, and I've screamed till my last breath, and our future shows will be no exception.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWith an incredible work ethic and a dedication to practicing their craft, Motionless In White has completed their line up with the addition of new bassist Ricky Horror, and emerged as a group of stunning musicians, with a firm hold on what they want to achieve. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This band is 100% bullshit free and we want to inspire kids to stand up for themselves and not be afraid to look the way they do or say the things that they want. If I can do for one person what my favorite bands and heroes have done for me then mission accomplished.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nimage\nArmed with their jaw-dropping debut album, support from the media and an impressive live show ready to take to the masses, Motionless In White is poised at the center of a perfect storm, and ready to take fans by the throat.
