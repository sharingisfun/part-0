Covering his prime stretch from the late '50s through the early '70s, 20 All-Time Greatest Hits! includes early R&amp;B milestones (&quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;), epochal '60s sides (&quot;Papa's Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1&quot;), and latter-day funk classics (&quot;Papa Don't Take No Mess, Pt. 1&quot;). And that's not to mention such perennials as &quot;Mother Popcorn,&quot; &quot;Hot Pants,&quot; &quot;Cold Sweat,&quot; and &quot;Think.&quot; Start your Brown obsession here. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1. &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot;\n2. &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine&quot;\n3. &quot;I Got the Feelin'&quot;\n4. &quot;Mother Popcorn, Pt. 1&quot;\n5. &quot;Give It Up or Turnit a Loose&quot;\n6. &quot;Make It Funky, Pt. 1&quot;\n7. &quot;Papa's Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. 1&quot;\n8. &quot;Think&quot;\n9. &quot;It's a Man's Man's Man's World&quot;\n10. &quot;Try Me&quot;\n11. &quot;Night Train&quot;\n12. &quot;Cold Sweat, Pt. 1&quot;\n13. &quot;Get on the Good Foot&quot;\n14. &quot;Papa Don't Take No Mess, Pt. 1&quot;\n15. &quot;The Payback&quot;\n16. &quot;Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud, Pt. 1&quot;\n17. &quot;Super Bad, Pts. 1 &amp; 2&quot;\n18. &quot;Hot Pants, Pt. 1&quot;\n19. &quot;Get Up Offa That Thing&quot;\n20. &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87eb0e5086e5fcdf2e27d7cd859e28e2ba2995c8","amp;dn":"James+Brown+-+20+All+Time+Greatest+Hits+%5BMP3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87eb0e5086e5fcdf2e27d7cd859e28e2ba2995c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,235,14,80,134,229,252,223,46,39,215,205,133,158,40,226,186,41,149,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
