  "description": "               Ableton Suite 8 v8.3.4 with Live 8.4b8 x86 x64\n\n\nType.................: Utility\nPlatform.............: Windows 9x/ME/2000\nMore Info............: http://www.ableton.com/\nCompression Format...: RAR\n\n\n\nAbleton Suite is a complete software studio. Suite 8 gives you all of the \nfeatures in Live 8 plus sound, with a radically new Library packed with \nbeautiful new sounds and a wealth of useful resources. Suite 8 contains 11 \nAbleton instruments and effects including synths, a sampler, electric and \nacoustic drums, mallets, numerous sampled instruments, the new, reworked \nOperator and amp modeling effects. Two completely new instruments, Collision and \nLatin Percussion, round off the set. Ableton Suite 8 is a complete package: the \ntools and the sounds.\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Release Notes\nImprovements and feature changes:\n\n    The word size of the Live application is now shown in the splash screen.\n    Live is now showing the email address of the currently authorized user \naccount in the &quot;About&quot; window.\n    Improved the authorization dialogue when launching Live as a Trial version.\n\nBugfixes:\n\n    Fixed a bug which could cause a &quot;memory corruption error&quot; when launching \nLive.\n    Fixed a memory leak which could occur when using the &quot;Complex&quot; warp mode. \n    The Session View selection frame of the APC40 or Launchpad could get stuck \nafter deleting scenes or undoing the creation of scenes.\n    Live device parameters would no longer update correctly after deleting a Max \nfor Live device which was mapped to that parameter via live.remote~.\n    Fixed a problem with the Max for Live engine, which would cause Live to \nfreeze when setting an audio buffer size smaller than 21 samples.\n    Fixed a graphical glitch in the Session- / Arrangement View amoeba after \ntoggling views (mixer, crossfader, etc.). \n    Fixed a problem with the Windows installer which could lead to an incomplete \ninstallation on some computers. Symptom: The Live application would not launch \nat all and an error message &quot;The application has failed to start due to a side-\nby-side configuration error&quot; would be shown instead.\n    Under certain conditions, the playback position in audio clips was incorrect \nafter changing clip start markers in unwarped clips and then re-enabling 'warp'. \n    Fixed a bug which prevented some VST plugins stored in the OS X system \nlibrary folder to show up in Live's browser.\n\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\nWindows: 2 GHz PentiumÃ‚Â® 4 or CeleronÃ‚Â® compatible CPU or faster (multicore CPU \nrecommended), 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended on Windows Vista and Windows 7), \nWindows XP (home or Pro), Windows Vista or Windows 7, sound card (ASIO driver \nsupport recommended), DVD-ROM drive, QuickTime recommended\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n     Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Next unrar files. \n       If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports \n       rar files such as Winrar.\n\n     Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Click on extract and then run the setup to install.\n\n     Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Go to crack folder and copy the crack to the installation dir by default* \nc/program files/Ableton/program paste replacing the original.\n\n     *Note - At the beguining of the installation, if the instaler gives the \ninstallation folder in C/program files/common files i recomend that you change \nto c/program files/\n\n     Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Now click on the Authorizelive8 file.\n\n           Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it! Done.\n\n                     3Nj0Y!!!",
