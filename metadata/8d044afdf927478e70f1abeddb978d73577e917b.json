  "description": "== About the game:\nAN UNCOMPROMISING WILDERNESS SURVIVAL GAME FULL OF SCIENCE AND MAGIC.\nPlay as Wilson, an intrepid Gentleman Scientist who has been trapped by a demon and transported to a mysterious wilderness world. Wilson must learn to exploit his environment and its inhabitants if he ever hopes to escape and find his way back home. Enter a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to craft items and structures that match your survival style. Play it your own way as you unravel the mysteries of this strange land.\n\n\n== Features (upcoming):\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Starve Together:\nGame Modes - There are three game modes intended: Survival, Endless and Wilderness.\nMods - Mods will be supported, yet many of them that rewrite core code will need to update to the new format.\nGhosts - Ghost Players are a new feature that introduces the ability to live after death, although in a downgraded state.\nRebalancing - Various rebalance tweaks including thermal stones, armor, willow enemies health.\nNew Entities - Meteors and The Ewecus\nSleeping - when on a server, sleeping will not fast forward to sunrise but will instead leave the player unable to move and not affected by the night monster.\nMap - The map has changed and there is now a fog of war, meaning that what is shown on the map is the version last seen.\n\n\n\n== Version:\nSteam v134235 full game with Reign of Giants, by LuKeStorm from Apr 21 2015. \nThanks to LuKeStorm for updating\n\n\n== Version changes:\n134235 - \n(to keep this page aethetically pleasing I'll shorten these changes)\n\n== DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Starve Together == \nStuff thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting added:\n Playable characters Wigfrid and Webber.\nTwo seasons: Spring and Summer. Season previously known as Summer will be henceforth known as Autumn.\nTwo new biomes: the Desert and the Deciduous Forest. Both are filled with new creatures, plants and gatherables. \nGiants for every season! Deerclops isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only big bad lurking out there, now.\n\nMechanical changes:\nRabbits and other small creatures that can go in your inventory need food too! \nFood left on crockpots and on drying racks will start spoiling before you collect it. \nIf your characters get wet enough, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start cooling down and losing sanity.\nPreviously, the rain would directly make you lose sanity.\nStructures with wood in them can burn. You can hammer down the burnt husk to get some resources back.\n\n== Reign of Giants ==\nFire propagation has been reworked. \nThe Ice Flingomatic has an emergency mode instead of being turned completely off. \nGiants are generally more present in the world, rather than jerks who come down from the proverbial hills to harass one unlucky player per season.\nThe color of a Thermal Stone is now based on its temperature relative to the ambient temperature of the world.\n\n\n== Instructions:1. Extract anywhere with compression software (like 7zip - download link below)\n2. Copy the content from the &quot;Crack&quot; folder into the game folder.\n3.
