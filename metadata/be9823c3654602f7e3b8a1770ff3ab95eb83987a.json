I have personally tried it on two computers with Windows 7 Ultimate SP1\nand had a few friends try it as well and there were no issues as such. Although I have not tried the SharePoint feature or tried to update it.\n\nHopefully it will work for you as well.\n\nScreenshot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaijAAAEL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaijAAAEL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPS:Having some network problems so seeding will neither be fast nor uninterrupted.
