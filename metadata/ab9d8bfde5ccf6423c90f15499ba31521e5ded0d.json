Choose the Standard edition for prototyping or go Pro to add documentation and collaboration features\n\n\n\nFrom Sketch To Polished\n\nThe fidelity your project needs\n\nQuickly create beautiful wireframes with boxes, placeholders, shapes, and text. When you're ready for more visual polish, add color, gradients, and semi-transparent fills, import images, use grids and guides for precise placement, or the many other tools designed to help you work at the right fidelity for your project.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Prototyping\n\nFrom clicks to conditions &amp; swipes\n\nCreate simple click-through mockups or highly functional, rich prototypes with conditional logic, dynamic content, animations, drag and drop, and calculations. You don't always need it, but when you do, it's nice to have the power to take your designs to the next level for your own evaluation, client feedback, or user testing.\n\n\n\n\nPublish &amp; Share\n\nGenerate HTML files or publish to Axure Share\n\nClick a button and Axure RP generates your design to an HTML and JavaScript prototype that can be viewed in IE, Firefox, Safari, or Chrome. Stakeholders, developers, and testers can view and interact with your prototype without installing Axure RP or a player. Publish your prototype to a network drive, web server, or Axure Share to share it.\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation &amp; Collaboration PRO\n\nFor those with Enterprising needs\n\nCreate Word templates with custom headers, footers, title page, and heading styles. Select from single or two column layouts. Configure the order of the screenshots, annotations, and page notes. Then, click a button to generate your custom specification any time and as many times as you update the design.\nu189_start u189_end u189_line\n\nUse Team Projects to work simultaneously with other team members on a project. Use a shared network drive or an SVN server for remote access. Keep a history of changes with notes for each check in. Export previous versions of the project whenever you need to see an earlier version of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows XP, 2003 Server, Vista, 7, or 8\n\n2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\n1 GHz Processor\n\n60 MB disk space\n\nFor specifications, Microsoft Office Word 2000,\n\nXP, 2003, 2007, or 2010\n\nFor prototypes, IE 7.0+, Firefox, Safari, or Chrome\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRar or other extractor of your choice to extract the rar file\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Install.\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Use the keygen to register\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
