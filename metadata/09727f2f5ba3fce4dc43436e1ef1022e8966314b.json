  "description": "[b][color=red][size=200]ABOUT[/size][/color][/b] \n\n[image=nYBWw8adsl]\n\n[i]In this new series, Foo Fighters commemorate their 20th anniversary by documenting the eight-city recording odyssey that produced their latest, and eighth, studio album.\n\nFoo Fighters founder Dave Grohl directs the series, which taps into the musical heritage and cultural fabric of eight cities: Chicago, Austin, Nashville, Los Angeles, Seattle, New Orleans, Washington D.C. and New York. The band based themselves at a legendary recording studio integral to the unique history and character of each location.\n\nOne song was recorded in each city, and every track features local legends. Even the lyrics were developed in an experimental, unprecedented way: Grohl held off on writing them until the last day of each session, letting himself be inspired by the experiences, interviews and personalities that became part of the process.\n\nFoo Fighters Sonic Highways is, in GrohlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words, Ã¢â‚¬Å“a love letter to the history of American music.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Each episode delves into the identity of each city -- showing how each region shaped these musicians in their formative years and, in turn, how they impacted the cultural fabric of their hometowns. Every artist who appears in the show, regardless of genre or locale, started as an average kid with universal dreams of making music and making it big.\n\nGrohl made his feature film directorial debut in 2013 with the universally acclaimed Grammy-winning Sound City, a celebration of the human element in the creation and recording of music. Foo Fighters have won 11 Grammy Awards, including four for Best Rock Album, more than any other band.\n\nPremiering on the eve of Foo FightersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 20th anniversary, Foo Fighters Sonic Highways aims to Ã¢â‚¬Å“give backÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the next generation of young musicians. As guitarist and singer Buddy Guy, an interviewee from the Chicago blues scene, explains, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything comes from whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come before.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[/i]\n\n[b][color=red][size=200]VIDEO[/size][/color][/b] \n\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 3 311 Kbps\nLength : 1.38 GiB for 59mn 32s 633ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 2 986 Kbps\nAspect : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 60.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC at 317 Kbps\nInfos : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en[b][color=black][/color][/b]",
