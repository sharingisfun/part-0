But many of those failures are preventable.  The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. \n\nEric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. \n\nThe Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.  Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on Ã¢â‚¬Å“validated learning,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. \n\nRather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ffd9c082cfce145822e1d8d93d32d9c2eb08f5","amp;dn":"The+Lean+Startup++-+Eric+Ries+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ffd9c082cfce145822e1d8d93d32d9c2eb08f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,255,217,192,130,207,206,20,88,34,225,216,217,61,50,217,194,235,8,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
