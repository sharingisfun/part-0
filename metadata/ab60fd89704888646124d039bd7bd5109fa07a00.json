The album was produced by Kevin Churko, who had previously produced Ozzy Osbourne's Black Rain, and mixed by Randy Staub, who had previously worked with Metallica, Nickelback, and Stone Sour. Guitarist Zoltan Bathory, commenting on the style of the album, stated &quot;we've continued the journey we started on the first album, so there's a healthy balance of melody and aggression, and as always we concentrated on writing strong metal songs in the traditional sense.&quot;\n\nBathory explained to Metal Hammer about the album title, &quot;It's a phrase we've had up our sleeves for some time, and I've been talking about it a lot in interviews. In fact, somebody just asked me: 'If war is the answer, then what is the question?', and I guess the answer to that is &quot;the meaning of life!&quot; Because life IS war. Basically, you're fighting against one thing or another right from the start Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you're fighting for survival with pretty much everything against you, you're fighting for social or political positions&quot;\nRelease\n\nAlthough War Is the Answer was originally announced to be released on June 8, 2009, but this was put back to October 6, 2009, then brought forward to September 22, 2009. On August 10, 2009, they announced the first leg of their Shock and Raw Tour, which will promote the new album. The second leg was announced on August 17, 2009.\n\nThe two bonus tracks, &quot;Succubus&quot; and &quot;Undone&quot; were originally cut from their first album The Way of the Fist. A demo version of &quot;Succubus&quot; was leaked onto the Internet under the title &quot;Hate Me&quot;. The band decided to re-record both songs and include them as bonus tracks on War Is the Answer.\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Five Finger Death Punch and Kevin Churko, except where noted. \nWar Is the Answer \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Dying Breed&quot;   \t2:54\n2. \t&quot;Hard to See&quot;   \t3:29\n3. \t&quot;Bulletproof&quot;   \t3:16\n4. \t&quot;No One Gets Left Behind&quot;   \t3:23\n5. \t&quot;Crossing Over&quot;   \t2:54\n6. \t&quot;Burn It Down&quot;   \t3:33\n7. \t&quot;Far from Home&quot;   \t3:32\n8. \t&quot;Falling in Hate&quot;   \t3:00\n9. \t&quot;My Own Hell&quot;   \t3:35\n10. \t&quot;Walk Away&quot;   \t3:42\n11. \t&quot;Canto 34&quot;   \t4:09\n12. \t&quot;Bad Company&quot; (Simon Kirke, Paul Rodgers) \t4:22\n13. \t&quot;War Is the Answer&quot;   \t3:20\nTotal length:\n\t45:16 \t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab60fd89704888646124d039bd7bd5109fa07a00","amp;dn":"Five+Finger+Death+Punch-War+Is+The+Answer+VBR++MP3++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab60fd89704888646124d039bd7bd5109fa07a00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,96,253,137,112,72,136,100,97,36,208,57,189,123,213,16,159,160,122,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
