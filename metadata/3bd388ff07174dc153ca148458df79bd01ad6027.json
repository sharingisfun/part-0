Sweetening the pot will be the first-ever release of the APPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth album The Sicilian Defence.\nThe Complete Albums Collection follows the 2013 Legacy Edition reissue of I Robot, the APPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1977 sophomore effort and Arista debut. That album proved that high-concept, progressive art-rock could still impact the charts when it placed in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200. Further triumphs were still to come for the studio group spearheaded by producer-engineer Alan Parsons (The Dark Side of the Moon) and songwriter-executive producer Eric Woolfson, especially 1982Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Eye in the Sky. The album shot to No. 7 on the Billboard 200, the APPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album since I Robot to crack the Top 10, and the Woolfson-written and Ã¢â‚¬â€œsung title track made it all the way to No. 3 on the Hot 100 and the Hot AC chart.\n\nThe Scottish band Pilot provided the Alan Parsons Project with its core musicians. Ian Bairnson (guitar) played on every APP album, David Paton (bass and vocals) appeared on all albums except the 1987 swansong Gaudi, and Stuart Tosh (drums) played on Tales of Mystery and Imagination and I Robot before joining 10cc and being replaced by Stuart Elliott of Cockney Rebel.  PilotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Billy Lyall also played keyboards on those first two APP albums.  It was a bit of reciprocity at work; Parsons had produced PilotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album including the hit single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Magic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and produced two more albums for the band as well.   Vocalists on the APP albums include Woolfson, Lesley Duncan (the contemporary standard Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Song,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ recorded by artists including Elton John, Dionne Warwick, and Neil Diamond), Clare Torry (The Dark Side of the Moon), Allan Clarke of The Hollies, Colin Blunstone of The Zombies, Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, Lenny Zakatek, John Miles and others.\n\nThe main attraction of the new box may be an album that nobody has ever heard.  The Sicilian Defence was created by Parsons and Woolfson over a three-day session at FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bear Studios and delivered to Arista Records in March 1981 amid tense contract negotiations between the Project and Clive DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Arista label.  The title derived from the name of a series of opening chess moves, which was apt considering the circumstances surrounding it.  Reportedly a dissonant, atonal collection that was far-removed from what Davis expected of the band, The Sicilian Defence was shelved.  The Project remained on Arista through 1987Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Gaudi, its final release.  (Parsons and Woolfson resumed their collaboration on the 1990 album Freudiana, the studio cast recording of a Woolfson-composed rock opera.)  An edited  version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElsieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ThemeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from The Sicilan Defence was included as a bonus track on an expanded edition of the 1979 album Eve, but the full-length track and the album from which it was derived makes its first-ever appearance as part of this box set.\n\nAll of the albums in the box set are presented in their original track listings, with no additional bonus tracks.  Alas, that means fans will have to hold onto Arista/LegacyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past reissues along with UniversalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deluxe release of Tales of Mystery and Imagination.  The masters used for The Alan Parsons Project Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Complete Albums Collection were overseen by Alan Parsons (likely for previous remastered editions, though that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet been confirmed) and each of the albums is presented in facsimile vinyl replica wallet sleeves reminiscent of those used in LegacyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s similar complete box sets.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bd388ff07174dc153ca148458df79bd01ad6027","amp;dn":"The+Alan+Parsons+Project+-+The+Complete+Albums+Collection+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bd388ff07174dc153ca148458df79bd01ad6027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,211,136,255,7,23,77,193,83,202,20,132,88,223,121,189,1,173,96,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
