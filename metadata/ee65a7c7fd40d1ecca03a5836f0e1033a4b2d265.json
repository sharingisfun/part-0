  "description": "\nWhen the download is complete, transfer the ISO file to installation media such as a DVD or USB flash drive.\n\nDouble-tap or double-click setup.exe from the installation media, and then follow the step\n\nDownload and install the preview only if you\n\nWant to try out software thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still in development and like sharing your opinion about it.\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind lots of updates or a UI design that might change significantly over time.\n\nReally know your way around a PC and feel comfortable troubleshooting problems, backing up data, formatting a hard drive, installing an operating system from scratch, or restoring your old one if necessary.\n\nKnow what an ISO file is and how to use it.\n\nAren't installing it on your everyday computer.\n\nWe're not kidding about the expert thing. So if you think BIOS is a new plant-based fuel, Tech Preview may not be right for you.\n\nUnexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything. Some printers and other hardware might not work, and some software might not install or work correctly, including antivirus or security programs. You might also have trouble connecting to home or corporate networks.\n\nAlso, if your PC runs into problems, Microsoft will likely examine your system files. If the privacy of your system files is a concern, consider using a different PC. For more info, read our privacy statement.\n\nIf you use a mouse and keyboard\n\nYour apps and devices should work as expected, though of course there will be exceptions. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love to know what you think about how the new Windows works with mouse and keyboard and whether it provides the best of new and familiar functionality for Windows and apps.\n\nIf you want to go back to your previous operating system\n\nYou'll need to reinstall your version of Windows from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC (typically DVD media).",
