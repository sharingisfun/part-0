  "description": "Keith Jarrett, The KÃƒÂ¶ln Concert, 1975\n\nJarrett's message from the keyboard took off from the small enclave of an informed and dedicated minority audience, and reached the huge worldwide constituency of listeners.\n\nAnd all this stemmed from the recording of a single album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ conceived as a live concert by a sleep-deprived Jarrett on a faulty grand piano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ made in KÃƒÂ¶ln, Germany, on 24 January 1975. \n\nFrom the glistening, patiently developed opening melody, through sustained passages of roaring riffs and folksy, country-song exuberance, the pianist is utterly inside his ongoing vision of the performance's developing shape Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a fusion of the freshness of an improvisation with the symmetries of a composition that's central to the album's communicative power.\n\n \nKEITH JARRETT\n\nThe KÃƒÂ¶ln Concert     1975\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nKeith Jarrett, piano\n\nRecorded at the Opera in Cologne, January 24th, 1975\n\n\nSales of The KÃƒÂ¶ln Concert, on Munich's fledgling new-music label, ECM, broke records of all kinds. It remains the bestselling solo album in jazz, and the bestselling solo piano album in any genre.\n\n:)",
