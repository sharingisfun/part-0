  "description": "Why is a Chinese guide to military strategy written in 330 to 320 B.C. so prevalent in modern military operations, business school curricula, sports, and popular culture? What can its lessons offer us today? \n\nAs award-winning Professor Andrew R. Wilson of the U.S. Naval War College demonstrates in the six expertly crafted lectures of The Art of War, this classic's wisdom for staying nimble in an ever-changing environment and for maximizing reward while minimizing risk remains eternally fresh. As war and business become more mental and less physical, human intellect plays an ever greater role in competition-making Sun Tzu's strategies highly relevant to the information age.\n\n\n\n6 lessons, ~30 minutes each\n\n1  The Origins of a Revolutionary Classic\n2  Command and Method\n3  Weather and Terrain\n4  Energy and Timing\n5  Espionage and Deception\n6  An Enduring Guide for Interesting Times\n\n",
