  "description": "Red Hot Chili Peppers - I Need a Hit(3-CD Deluxe) 2016 320ak\r\n\r\nRed Hot Chili Peppers, also sometimes shortened to &quot;The Chili Peppers&quot; or abbreviated as &quot;RHCP&quot;, are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Flea (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith; and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late-2009, replacing John Frusciante. \r\n\r\nRed Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time with over 80 million records sold worldwide, have been nominated for sixteen Grammy Awards, of which they have won six and are the most successful band in alternative rock radio history currently holding the records for most number one singles , most cumulative weeks at number one  and most top-ten songs  on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nThe newest release from them will be in June 2016. So until that happens I decided to put together this compilation. Because &quot;I Need a Hit&quot;...\r\nYou Need a Hit...\r\nWe all Need a Hit...
