It's about a band of rogue DJs that captivated Britain, playing the music that defined a generation and standing up to a government that wanted classical music, and nothing else, on the airwaves. The Count, a big, brash, American god of the airwaves; Quentin, the boss of Radio Rock -- a pirate radio station in the middle of the North Sea that's populated by an eclectic crew of rock and roll DJs; Gavin, the greatest DJ in Britain who has just returned from his drug tour of America to reclaim his rightful position; Dave, an ironic, intelligent and cruelly funny co-broadcaster; and a fearsome British government official out for blood against the drug takers and lawbreakers of a once-great nation. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b7ac4f25cbcbebdb396f66d31579df42ee50c3","amp;dn":"Pirate+Radio+%282009%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b7ac4f25cbcbebdb396f66d31579df42ee50c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,183,172,79,37,203,203,235,219,57,111,102,211,21,121,223,66,238,80,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
