  "description": "Radiohead\nThe Best Of Radiohead (2008)\n\n\nRadiohead were one of the few alternative bands of the early '90s to draw heavily from the grandiose arena rock that characterized U2's early albums. But the band internalized that epic sweep, turning it inside out to tell tortured, twisted tales of angst and alienation. Vocalist Thom Yorke's pained lyrics were brought to life by the group's three-guitar attack, which relied on texture -- borrowing as much from My Bloody Valentine and Pink Floyd as R.E.M. and Pixies -- instead of virtuosity. It took Radiohead a while to formulate their signature sound. Their 1993 debut, Pablo Honey, only suggested their potential, and one of its songs, &quot;Creep,&quot; became an unexpected international hit, its angst-ridden lyrics making it an alternative rock anthem. Many observers pigeonholed Radiohead as a one-hit wonder, but the group's second album, The Bends, was released to terrific reviews in the band's native Britain in early 1995, helping build a more stable fan base. Having demonstrated unexpected staying power, as well as increasing ambition, Radiohead next released OK Computer, a progressive, electronic-tinged masterpiece that became one of the most acclaimed albums of the '90s.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Just\n02.Paranoid Android\n03.Karma Police\n04.Creep\n05.No Surprises\n06.High And Dry\n07.My Iron Lung\n08.There There\n09.Lucky\n10.Optimistic\n11.Fake Plastic Trees\n12.Idiotesque\n13.2+2=5\n14.The Bends\n15.Pyramid Song\n16.Street Spirit (Fade Out)\n17.Everything In Its Right Place\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n",
