I use the social sciences as a bridge to understanding our primate nature because they are the principal academic avenues for exploring our social behaviors and activities. The social sciences also provide useful theoretical and explanatory understandings of our conscious and unconscious behaviors. Our organic origins are situated in biology, but we clearly live in more complex social roles and groupings than other primates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9541c7b0efb51c27fe02eb480f454fb8728eb06c","amp;dn":"The+Evolving+Human+Primate+2016+EPUB+WWRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9541c7b0efb51c27fe02eb480f454fb8728eb06c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,65,199,176,239,181,28,39,254,2,235,72,15,69,79,184,114,142,176,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
