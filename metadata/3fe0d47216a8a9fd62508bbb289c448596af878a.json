  "description": "Talking Heads was an American rock band formed in 1974 in New York City and active until 1991. The band comprised David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison. Auxiliary musicians also frequently made appearances in concert and on the group's albums.\n\nThe new wave musical style of Talking Heads combined elements of punk rock, avant-garde, pop, funk, world music and art rock. Frontman and songwriter David Byrne contributed whimsical, esoteric lyrics to the band's songs, and emphasized their showmanship through various multimedia projects and performances. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Talking Heads as being &quot;one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s, while managing to earn several pop hits.&quot;\n\nIn 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of the band's albums appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the Channel 4 100 Greatest Albums poll listed one album (Fear of Music) at number seventy-six. Their concert film Stop Making Sense is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of the genre.\n\nAlbums:\n\nTalking Heads: 77\n\n1.\t&quot;Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town&quot;  \t                         \n2.\t&quot;New Feeling&quot;  \t                                         \n3.\t&quot;Tentative Decisions&quot;  \t                                 \n4.\t&quot;Happy Day&quot;  \t                                      \n5.\t&quot;Who Is It?&quot;  \t\n6.\t&quot;No Compassion&quot;  \t\n7.\t&quot;The Book I Read&quot;  \t\n8.\t&quot;Don't Worry About the Government&quot;  \t\n9.\t&quot;First Week/Last WeekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Carefree&quot;  \t\n10.\t&quot;Psycho Killer&quot; (David Byrne, Chris Frantz, and Tina Weymouth)\t\n11.\t&quot;Pulled Up&quot;  \t\n12.\t&quot;Love ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Building on Fire&quot;  \t\n13.\t&quot;I Wish You Wouldn't Say That&quot;  \t\n14.\t&quot;Psycho Killer (Acoustic Version)&quot; \n15.\t&quot;I Feel It in My Heart&quot;  \t\n16.\t&quot;Sugar On My Tongue&quot;  \t\n\n\nMore Songs About Buildings and Food:\n\n\n1.      &quot;Thank You for Sending Me an Angel&quot;\n2.      &quot;With Our Love&quot;\n3.      &quot;The Good Thing&quot;\n4.      &quot;Warning Sign&quot;\n5.      &quot;The Girls Want to Be With the Girls&quot;\n6.      &quot;Found a Job&quot;\n7.      &quot;Artists Only&quot; (Byrne, Wayne Zieve)\n8.      &quot;I'm Not in Love&quot;\n9.      &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (Byrne, Chris Frantz)\n10.     &quot;Take Me to the River&quot; (Al Green, Teenie Hodges)\n11.     &quot;The Big Country&quot;\n12.     &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (1977 version)\n13.     &quot;I'm Not In Love&quot; (Alternate Version)\n14.     &quot;The Big Country&quot; (Alternate Version)\n15.     &quot;Thank You For Sending Me An Angel&quot; (Country Angel Version)\n\nFear of Music:\n\n 1.     &quot;I Zimbra&quot;\n 2.     &quot;Mind&quot; \n 3.     &quot;Paper&quot;\n 4.     &quot;Cities&quot;\n 5.     &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;\n 6.     &quot;Memories Can't Wait&quot;\n 7.     &quot;Air&quot;\n 8.     &quot;Heaven&quot;\n 9.     &quot;Animals&quot;\n10.     &quot;Electric Guitar&quot;\n11.     &quot;Drugs&quot;\n12.     &quot;Dancing for Money&quot; [Unfinished Outtake][#][-]\n13.     &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; [Alternate Version][#][-]\n14.     &quot;Cities&quot; [Alternate Version][#][-]\n15.     &quot;Mind&quot; [Alternate Version][#][-]\n\nRemain in Light:\n\n1.      &quot;Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)&quot;\n2.      &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot;\n3.      &quot;The Great Curve&quot;\n4.      &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;\n5.      &quot;Houses in Motion&quot;\n6.      &quot;Seen and Not Seen&quot;\n7.      &quot;Listening Wind&quot;\n8.      &quot;The Overload&quot;\n9.      &quot;Fela's Riff&quot;\n10.     &quot;Unison&quot;\n11.     &quot;Double Groove&quot;\n12.     &quot;Right Start&quot;\n\nSpeaking in Tongues:\n\n 1.     &quot;Burning Down the House&quot;\n 2.     &quot;Making Flippy Floppy&quot;\n 3.     &quot;Girlfriend Is Better&quot;\n 4.     &quot;Slippery People&quot;\n 5.     &quot;I Get Wild/Wild Gravity&quot;\n 6.     &quot;Swamp&quot;\n 7.     &quot;Moon Rocks&quot;\n 8.     &quot;Pull Up the Roots&quot;\n 9.     &quot;This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)&quot;\n10.     &quot;Two Note Swivel&quot;\n11.     &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; (Alternate Version)\n\nLittle Creatures:\n\n1.      &quot;And She Was&quot; \n2.      &quot;Give Me Back My Name&quot;\n3.      &quot;Creatures of Love&quot; \n4.      &quot;The Lady Don't Mind&quot; \n5.      &quot;Perfect World&quot; (Byrne and Frantz) \n6.      &quot;Stay Up Late&quot; \n7.      &quot;Walk It Down&quot;\n8.      &quot;Television Man&quot; \n9.      &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;\n10.     &quot;Road To Nowhere&quot; (Early Version)\n11.     &quot;And She Was&quot; (Early Version)\n12.     &quot;Television Man&quot; (Extended Mix)\n\nTrue Stories:\n\n1.      &quot;Love for Sale&quot;\n2.      &quot;Puzzlin' Evidence&quot;\n3.      &quot;Hey Now&quot;\n4       &quot;Papa Legba&quot;\n5.      &quot;Wild Wild Life&quot;\n6.      &quot;Radio Head&quot;\n7.      &quot;Dream Operator&quot;\n8.      &quot;People Like Us&quot;\n9.      &quot;City of Dreams&quot;\n10.     &quot;Wild Wild Life (Extended Mix) \n11.     &quot;Papa Legba (Pops Staples Vocal Version) [Re-release bonus track]\n12.     &quot;Radio Head (Tito Larriva Vocal Version) [Re-release bonus track]\n\nNaked:\n\n1.      &quot;Blind&quot; \n2.      &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; \n3.      &quot;Totally Nude&quot; \n4.      &quot;Ruby Dear&quot; \n5.      &quot;(Nothing But) Flowers&quot;\n6.      &quot;The Democratic Circus&quot;\n7.      &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; \n8.      &quot;Mommy Daddy You and I&quot; \n9.      &quot;Big Daddy&quot; \n10.     &quot;Bill&quot; (CD/cassette-only bonus track)\n11.     &quot;Cool Water&quot; \n12.     &quot;Sax And Violins&quot;",
