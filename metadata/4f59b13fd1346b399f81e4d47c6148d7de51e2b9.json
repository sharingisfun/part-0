  "description": "Divergente 2: L'insurrection (2015)\n&quot;Insurgent&quot; (original title)\n119 min - Adventure, Sci-Fi, Thriller - 18 March 2015\n\nOne choice can transform you-or it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves--and herself--while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love. Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable--and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships. Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.\n\nDirector: Robert Schwentke\nWriters: Brian Duffield, Akiva Goldsman, Mark Bomback, Veronica Roth,\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/247/nnMXmoJt.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/247/nnMXmoJt.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1664/h9hx0URo.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1664/h9hx0URo.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1293/53SlPFtM.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1293/53SlPFtM.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/438/BFTVDKIn.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/438/BFTVDKIn.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVideo: x264 mp4 1268kbps 720x352 30fps 1h 47mn 1.15 GiB\nAudio: English AAC 256kbps 2 Channels\nSample: 2 included\nEncoder: CPG\n\n\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2908446/\n\nnote\n\nwell i used italian source they are brining some good videos lately. so went with it. did usual stuff then fixed color, sharp, bright, rbg, came out sweet. main problem with recent italian sources are flicker and video noise. i almost kill flicker in this one was wondering how to kill without blurring or losing too much video detail i think i found mid way and went with it. now flicker is almost gone. in few scenes video does have dot noise but it dont last forever.\ni was waiting for line But non showed up so used hive audio run through some usual stuff its good to hear and understandable then synced over my video. went smooth.\nits CAM to be honest with good cam audio at best. not hdhqmichqmegahq i mean lol\n2 video samples included. kindly check them both.\nEnjoy",
