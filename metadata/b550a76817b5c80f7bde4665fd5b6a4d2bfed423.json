Hope ou guys enjoy and please help seed.\n\n\n-----------------\n\n\nIncluded FREE goodies: \n\n7 avatars \n\n6 concept arts\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\n Take the helm of your customised steamship and set sail for the unknown! Sunless Sea is a 2D game of discovery, survival and loneliness set in the award-winning Victorian Gothic universe of Fallen London. Will you succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Or return home triumphant with a hold full of precious loot?\n\nEvents can turn out differently every game - sometimes, even if you make the same choices. Will you lose your sweetheart to a curse? Redeem, betray or consume the Genial Magician? Sell your soul to the Wistful Deviless or spurn her advances? Is the Dawn Machine your salvation, or your doom?\n\nYou are the captain. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your call.\n\n\n*Light and dark. Stray too far from the gas-lamps of civilisation and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. But there is treasure out there in the darknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n*Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, flensing cannons, and pneumatic torpedo guns. Or just buy a bigger, better ship.\n\n*Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them.\n\n*Choose from a menagerie of shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascots: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more!\n\n*Trade silk and souls, mushroom wine, and hallucinogenic honey.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/sunless_sea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/sunless_sea&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b550a76817b5c80f7bde4665fd5b6a4d2bfed423","amp;dn":"Sunless+Sea+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b550a76817b5c80f7bde4665fd5b6a4d2bfed423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,80,167,104,23,181,200,15,123,222,70,101,253,91,106,77,43,254,212,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
