  "description": "100 Skills You'll Need for the End of the World (as We Know It)\nby Ana Maria Spagna\nStorey Publishing, LLC | May 2015 | ISBN: 1612124569 | ePUB | 22 mb\n\nWhat skills will you need after a global catastrophe? Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the end of oil, an environmental disaster, or something entirely unforeseen, Ana Maria Spagna outlines 100 skills youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find indispensable for life after the apocalypse. Once the dust has settled, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to know how to barter, perform basic first aid, preserve food, cut your own hair, clean a chimney, navigate by the stars, stitch a wound, darn socks, and sharpen blades. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also want to build a stable and safe community, so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to master the arts of conversation, child raising, listening, music making, and storytelling. This fascinating and entertaining book, full of quirky illustrations by artist Brian Cronin, will provoke surprise, debate, and laughter while it provides a road map to greater self-reliance and joy, whatever the future brings.\n\nAbout the Author\nAna Maria lives and writes in Stehekin, Washington, a remote community in the North Cascades accessible only by boat, foot, or float plane. After working for fifteen years on trail crews in national parks and forests, she now teaches creative nonfiction at the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts where she serves as assistant director of the MFA program.\n\nCONTENTS\nFuture Tense\n1.
