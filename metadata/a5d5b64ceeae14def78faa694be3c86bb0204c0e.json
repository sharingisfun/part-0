  "description": "Motley Crue\nGreatest Hits (1998)\n\nMÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e were one of the most influential hair metal bands of the '80s, boasting a striking visual presence and hedonistic reputation rivaled only by Guns N' Roses. By combining Alice Cooper's shock rock with the bluesy, metallic stomp of the New York Dolls and Aerosmith, they helped establish hair metal as a commercial genre, sending their first five albums to platinum status in the process. Such success was at least partially due to MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e's reputation as a riotous pack of rabble-rousers, replete with drug addictions, near-death experiences, groupie encounters, and celebrity girlfriends. Of course, that same self-indulgence nearly derailed the band, forcing the musicians to embrace sobriety during the creation of their most successful album to date, 1989's Dr. Feelgood. Like most hair metal bands, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e's album sales waned during the 1990s, as the popularity of grunge overshadowed most of the music that immediately prefaced it. Nevertheless, the band soldiered through the decade with modest success, releasing two gold-selling albums along the way. The new millennium brought similar luck, as MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e established themselves as a fashionable touring act (with CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e Fest becoming the summer's highest-grossing festival in 2008) while continuing to release new material.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Bitter Pill\n02.Enslaved\n03.Girls, Girls, Girls\n04.Kickstart My Heart\n05.Wild Side\n06.Glitter\n07.Dr. Feelgood\n08.Same Ol' Situation\n09.Home Sweet Home\n10.Afraid\n11.Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\n12.Without You\n13.Smokin' in The Boys Room\n14.Primal Scream\n15.Too Fast for Love\n16.Looks That Kill\n17.Shout At The Devil '97\n",
