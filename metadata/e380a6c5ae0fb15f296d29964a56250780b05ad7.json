  "description": " The Principles of a Protagonist Bundle\n\nChicago native Willis Earl Beal came from humble musical beginnings- he began as a street performer of sorts that was prone to leaving homemade novels, artwork and CD-Rs across America to promote his work, suggesting a desire to be heard. Thereafter, he relocated to Albuquerque, NM where he continued his practice of 'gifting' as he simultaneously recorded a set of songs on a discarded karaoke machine that would become Acousmatic Sorcery, his Hot Charity/XL Recordings debut.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨BitTorrent has collaborated with Willis Earl Beal to gift curious listeners with Principles of a Protagonist, the soundtrack to Beal's new short-animated film of the same name. The Bundle exemplifies Beal's desire to be heard on his own terms and demonstrates that- despite all the critical acclaim- his want of gifting music to the world has not changed.\nDownload the Principles of a Protagonist Bundle and get:\n\n * The Principles of a Protagonist soundtrack\n * Album Art\n * The Principles of a Protagonist tour flier\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/willisearlbeal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/willisearlbeal/&lt;/a&gt;\n",
