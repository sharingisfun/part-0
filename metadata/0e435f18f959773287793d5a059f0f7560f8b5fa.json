  "description": "Imagine is the second studio rock album by John Lennon. Recorded and released in 1971, it tended towards songs that were gentler, more commercial and less primal rock than those on his previous album, the critically acclaimed John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The album is considered the most popular of his works. In 2012, Imagine was voted 80th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. \n\nTrack Listing **** 2010 Remaster **** [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Imagine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n    &quot;Crippled Inside&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n    &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:14\n    &quot;It's So Hard&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:25\n    &quot;I Don't Want to Be a Soldier, Mama, I Don't Want to Die&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:05\n    &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n    &quot;Oh My Love&quot; (LennonÃ¢Ë†â€™Yoko Ono) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n    &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:36\n    &quot;How?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:43\n    &quot;Oh Yoko!&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\n\n\n**** The John Lennon Signature Box is an 11-disc box set of remastered John Lennon albums and new collections, released on CD and digital format, as part of the &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; collection.
