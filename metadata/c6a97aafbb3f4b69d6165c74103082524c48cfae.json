  "description": "Pink Floyd The Wall (1982)\n\nDirector: Alan Parker\n\nPink Floyd The Wall is a 1982 British live-action/animated musical film directed by Alan Parker based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album The Wall. The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters. The film is highly metaphorical and is rich in symbolic imagery and sound. It features very little dialogue and is mainly driven by Pink Floyd's music.\n\nThe film contains fifteen minutes of elaborate animation sequences by the political cartoonist and illustrator Gerald Scarfe, part of which depict a nightmarish vision of the German bombing campaign over the United Kingdom during World War II set to the song &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot;.\n\nRoger Waters has expressed deep reservations about the film, saying that the filming had been &quot;a very unnerving and unpleasant experience... we all fell out in a big way.&quot; As for the film itself, he said: &quot;I found it was so unremitting in its onslaught upon the senses, that it didn't give me, anyway, as an audience, a chance to get involved with it,&quot; although he had nothing but praise for Geldof's performance. Parker, who frequently clashed with Waters and Gerald Scarfe, described the filming as &quot;one of the most miserable experiences of my creative life.&quot; David Gilmour stated (on the &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; episodes of The Wall, A Momentary Lapse of Reason and On an Island) that the conflict between him and Waters started with the making of the film. Gilmour also stated on the documentary Behind The Wall (which was aired on the BBC in the UK and VH1 in the US) that &quot;the movie was the less successful telling of The Wall story as opposed to the album and concert versions.&quot;\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Pink Floyd The Wall (1982)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Pink Floyd The Wall (1982)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 944 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 387 Kbps\nMovie name                       : DVD_VIDEO.Title1.DVDRip\nWriting application              : Lavf52.78.4\nOriginal source form/Name        : DVD_VIDEO\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 2\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nBit rate                         : 1 055 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 306 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.200\nStream size                      : 718 MiB (76%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 218 MiB (23%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 24 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.4\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 6061\n3/15/2011 12:49:00 AM\nmbam-log-2011-03-15 (00-49-00).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 7 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
