Pearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness follows, moment by moment, the sailors, soldiers, pilots, diplomats, admirals, generals, emperor, and president as they engineer, fight, and react to this stunningly dramatic moment in world history.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1914, bestselling author Craig Nelson maps the road to war, beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and not yet afflicted with polio), attending the laying of the keel of the USS Arizona at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Writing with vivid intimacy, Nelson traces Japanâ€™s leaders as they lurch into ultranationalist fascism, which culminates in their insanely daring yet militarily brilliant scheme to terrify America with one of the boldest attacks ever waged. Within seconds, the country would never be the same.\r\n\r\nIn addition to learning the little understood history of how and why Japan attacked Hawaii, we hear an abandoned record player endlessly repeating â€œSunrise Serenadeâ€ as bombs shatter the decks of the California; we feel cold terror as lanky young American sailors must anxiously choose between staying aboard their sinking ships or diving overboard into harbor waters aflame with burning ship fuel; we watch as Navy wives tearfully hide with their children in caves from a rumored invasion, and we understand the frustration and triumph of a lone American teenager as he shoots down a Japanese bomber, even as the attack destroys hundreds of US airplanes and dozens of ships","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02ff64ff36458973696303352573b91a0e1f0f39","amp;dn":"Pearl+Harbor%3A+From+Infamy+to+Greatness+%282016%29+Craig+Nelson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02ff64ff36458973696303352573b91a0e1f0f39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,255,100,255,54,69,137,115,105,99,3,53,37,115,185,26,14,31,15,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
