Accessible and non-academic, the book is a compendium of exercises, strategies, tips and techniques to sharpen memory skills. An introductory chapter explains what &quot;memory&quot; is, the different types we have and how they work together to gather, sift and process information. It explains some of the reasons why we forget and asks whether it is possible to improve the ability to learn and recall information. Throughout this section there are many exercises to complete offering interactivity, which is a major element of the book. The &quot;exercise&quot; chapters (2-7) focus on how to improve short-term memory, long-term memory, creative memory (imagination) organizational memory, plus there are chapters for improving memory in everyday tasks, such as remembering names and faces, to-do lists, and long numbers. Each of these chapters begins with a &quot;check-in&quot; self-assessment. A variety of exercises follow, punctuated by technique features. Helpful tips and strategies pop up throughout these chapters too. Each chapter ends with a round of &quot;check-out&quot; exercises allowing the reader to compare their result with the &quot;check-in&quot; score and assess their overall improvement. The final chapter focuses on the importance of physical health to memory, with tips on how to manage stress and deal with sleep issues. It also offers a range of physical exercises and diet tips which can have a positive effect on the ability to retain memories and form new ones.\n\n\n=================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3892f00a072f458953ed6875a5ec4fae2c7399f3","amp;dn":"Max+Your+Memory+-+200+Exercises+Tips+and+Strategies+to+Boost+you","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3892f00a072f458953ed6875a5ec4fae2c7399f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,146,240,10,7,47,69,137,83,237,104,117,165,236,79,174,44,115,153,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
