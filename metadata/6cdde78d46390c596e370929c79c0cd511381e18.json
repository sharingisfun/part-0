  "description": "== About the game:\n\nApotheon is a 2D platform action-RPG set on the rich stage of ancient Greek mythology. Hera, the queen of Olympus, has overthrown her husband Zeus, and taken his throne as ruler of the Gods. Bitter and scornful towards the race of mortals, she launches a murderous campaign to scour them from the earth. As humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last champion, you must pass through the land of the dead, infiltrate Mount Olympus, and end the wrath of the Gods. With sword, spear, and shield in hand, you will sneak, conspire, loot, and battle your way through majestic palaces and chthonic depths as you climb towards godhood. Only by stripping the old gods of their powers, and taking control of the elements as your own, can humanity hope to survive the coming oblivion.\n\n\n== Features:\n\nBrutal and bloody bronze-aged combat! Slay your enemies with swords, spears, arrows, and other ancient weapons of war.\nExplore the massive open world of Mount Olympus! Battle mythical beings and search for divine treasure across the Forests of Artemis, the Palaces of Apollo, and other sanctuaries of the Gods.\nGuide the rise of Nikandreos, humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last hero. Interact with a colourful cast of fully voiced legendary characters throughout a rich single-player experience.\nChallenge your friends to single combat! In one versus one local multiplayer, pit your skills against other would-be heroes of Greece.\nLearn a little about Greek Mythology! Apotheon tries to stay true to its source material. Read an excerpt from the Iliad about Diomedes before you stick a Xiphos through his Aspis.\n\n\n== Version:\n\nGOG setup 2.0.0.1\nThere should be a GOG patch released soon\nIncluded Apotheon Soundtrack from Steam\n\n\n== Instructions:\n\nIt's a GOG version, just launch setup\nClick options to chose location and accept EULA, install\nPlay - Enjoy - Seed \nYou know what I need - Speed!
