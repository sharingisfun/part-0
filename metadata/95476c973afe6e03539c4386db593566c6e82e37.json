  "description": "Make - Edible Inventions Cooking Hacks and Yummy Recipes You Can Build, Mix, Bake and Grow (2016) (Pdf) Gooner\r\n\r\nPublisher: Oâ€²Reilly (30 Sept. 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1680452096\r\nISBN-13: 978-1680452099\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, there's a lot of inventing going on in the kitchen. Unless you only eat fruits and veggies right off the plant, you are using tools and techniques invented by humans to make food more tasty and easier to digest. When you cook food, you start to break it down into a form your body can absorb. When you add chemicals to make it thicker, gooey-er, or puffy-er, you turn a bunch of boring ingredients into a mouth-watering snack. Edible Inventions: Cooking Hacks and Yummy Recipes You Can Build, Mix, Bake, and Grow will show you some unusual ways to create a meal, and help you invent some of your own. Projects include: 3D printing with food Chemical cuisine and molecular gastronomy Prepared foods like jellies and pickles at home Growing your own ingredients Cooking off the grid",
