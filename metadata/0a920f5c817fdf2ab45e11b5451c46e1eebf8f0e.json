  "description": "Illustrator's Guide to Pen and Pencil Drawing Techniques\nby Harry Borgman\nWatson-Guptill | August 1989 | ISBN-10: 0823025381 | PDF | 256 pages | 41.8 mb\n\nThis volume provides comprehensive instruction in pencil and ink techniques for beginning illustrators and commercial artists. The author, who has also written &quot;Drawing in Ink&quot; and &quot;The Pen and Pencil Technique Book&quot;, thoroughly documents key materials and tools. He demonstrates all graphite stroke techniques and variations, then shows how these techniques can be combined to create effective finished pieces of art. Also included is step-by-step instruction for creating works in charcoal, carbon, wax, and colored pencil. The section on ink drawing is similarly structured, with advice on materials, demonstrations of stroke techniques, and detailed instruction for creating successful finished work. Artists will also learn how to combine ink with such other media as wash and markers. The subject matter is diverse; included are portraits, landscapes, and still lifes.\n\nCONTENTS\nPREFACE 7\nINTRODUCTION 9\nPART 1. PENCIL DRAWING &quot;77\n1. MATERIALS AND TOOLS 12\n2.
