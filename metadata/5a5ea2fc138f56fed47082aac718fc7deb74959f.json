Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's &quot;precious&quot; ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities ... A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to ...\r\n\r\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:-\r\n\r\nAfter successfully crossing over (and under) the Misty Mountains, Thorin and Company must seek aid from a powerful stranger before taking on the dangers of Mirkwood Forest--without their Wizard. If they reach the human settlement of Lake-town it will be time for the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract with the dwarves. The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and burglar Baggins must seek out the Secret Door that will give them access to the hoard of the dragon Smaug. And, where has Gandalf got off to? And what is his secret business to the south?\r\n\r\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:-\r\n\r\nAfter the Dragon leaves the Lonely Mountain, the people of Lake-town see a threat coming. Orcs, dwarves, elves and people prepare for war. Bilbo sees Thorin going mad and tries to help. Meanwhile, Gandalf is rescued from the Necromancer's prison and his rescuers realize who the Necromancer is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIan McKellen:...Gandalf\r\nMartin Freeman:...Bilbo Baggins\r\nRichard Armitage:...Thorin Oakenshield\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch:...Smaug\r\nEvangeline Lilly:...Tauriel\r\nLee Pace:...Thranduil\r\nCate Blanchett:...Galadriel\r\nLuke Evans:...Bard the Bowman\r\nKen Stott:...Balin\r\nJames Nesbitt:...Bofur\r\nOrlando Bloom:...Legolas\r\nJohn Bell:...Bain\r\nManu Bennett:...Azog\r\nJed Brophy:...Nori\r\nAdam Brown:...Ori\r\nJohn Callen:...Oin\r\nStephen Fry:...Master of Laketown\r\nRyan Gage:...Alfrid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat :mkv/AVC \r\nWriting Library :x264    \r\nDuration : 3h 06mn 30sec / 3h 06mn 32sec / 2h 44mn 03sec\r\nBitrate : 3 418 Kbps / 3 217 Kbps / 4 366 Kbps\r\nResolution=Width/Height :1920 x 800 pixels\r\nFrame Rate :23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat :AC3 \r\nBitrate : 640 Kbps\r\nChannels :6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English \r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \r\nTitle/Year : &quot;An Unexpected Journey-The Desolation of Smaug-The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; / 2012-13-14 \r\nFile Size : 5.28 GiB  / 5.13 GiB / 5.85 GiB\r\nGenre :Adventure | Fantasy\r\nSource : BLURAY-FULLSiZE / BluRay REMUX-HDCLUB / BluRay REMUX-FraMeSToR[Thanks]\r\nChapters :Yes\r\nSample :Yes \r\n\r\nIMDB :   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/\r\nSubtitles(VobSub): English(SDH),Arabic,Danish,Finnish,Hebrew,Hungarian,Icelandic,Norwegian.\r\nSubtitles(VobSub): Polish,Portuguese[2],Romanian,Swedish,Spanish(Latin),Japanese,French.\r\nSubtitles(srt): Dutch,Serbian,Brazilian,Italian,Romanian,Spanish,Bulgarian,Greek .\r\nSubtitles(hardcoded): English were needed from source.\r\n\r\nIMDB :    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1170358/\r\nSubtitles(VobSub):English(SDH),French,Japanese[3].\r\nSubtitles(srt):English(SDH),English,Indonesian,Spanish.\r\nSubtitles(srt):Arabic,Vietnamese,Persian,Norwegian,Greek.\r\nSubtitles(hardcoded): English were needed from source.\r\n\r\nIMDB :    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2310332/\r\nSubtitles(VobSub):English(SDH),French,Italian.\r\nSubtitles(srt):English(SDH),Arabic,Indonesian,Persian,Greek.\r\nSubtitles(hardcoded): English were needed from source.\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyK \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyZ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/Cye \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/Cy4 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyB \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyC\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyY \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/Cyp \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/Cyr \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyG \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyP \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyX\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/Cyg \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/Cy5 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyD \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyF \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/CyH \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/Cyk\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|Hand_of_Doom|BADASSMEDIA|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a5ea2fc138f56fed47082aac718fc7deb74959f","amp;dn":"The.Hobbit.The.Motion.Picture.Trilogy.EXTENDED.1080p.BluRay-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a5ea2fc138f56fed47082aac718fc7deb74959f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,94,162,252,19,143,86,254,212,112,130,170,199,24,252,125,235,116,149,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
