Highly recommended.\n\n- I've been an IS project manager for over 10 years. I've studied ITIL materials in preparation, but took no courses or workshops. I studied this book and its accompanying course for 10 days immediately preceding my exam. Read the book about 3 times.\n\n- I took the ITIL Foundation exam and got 98% of the questions correct. I think that the study tips in the book and course helped me get about 15-20 questions right that I might have otherwise missed. (your mileage may vary).\n\n- The book and course made me confident in sitting the exam, and is the best such book that I've come across.\n\n- Worth it especially since you have access to the online learning component as well.\n\n- Good focus on ITIL's processes (things important to ITIL Foundation and passing the test that your experience in IT may not help you)\n\n- Highly recommended, I passed in one go!",
