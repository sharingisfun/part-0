Just send them a small settings file and have them copy it to the appropriate folder.\n\nCustomizable settings in Final Cut Pro - Final Cut Pro lets you access the complete library of export settings available in Compressor.

After saving your changes to the setting, you can access it directly from the Destinations preference pane in Final Cut Pro.\n\nStreamlined workflow - Quickly execute common encoding tasks by selecting from a list of presets and destinations like iPhone, iPad, and video websites like YouTube and Vimeo. For more advanced exports, open the Inspector to access all custom controls in a single window.\n\nCustom Destinations - Destinations allow you to combine an encode setting with a post-encode action, which automates tasks such as emailing, copying, and moving files or executing a custom script.\n\nIndustry-Standard Encoding Support\n\nEncode video for Apple devices - Compressor includes a variety of presets that make it easy to deliver content for Apple devices Ã¢â‚¬â€ including iPad, iPhone, iPod, and Apple TV.

You can even include an audio track when you encode.\n\nBroad format support - Quickly set up encoding jobs for a broad range of industry-standard formats, including MPEG-2, H.264, and QuickTime. Or encode to ProRes for stunning quality at surprisingly small file sizes. If you encode files for HTTP live streaming, Compressor delivers all the files you need in a single web-ready folder.

Compressor offers advanced optical flow analysis to produce format and standards conversions at exceptional image quality.\n\nVideo retiming - Speed up video, slow it down, or adjust the frame rate to make the duration match a specific runtime. Compressor produces pristine retiming effects, complete with automatic pitch adjustment for audio.\n\nDynamic image filters - Choose from a set of convenient image filters to customize and clean up your content as you encode. Easily add a timecode overlay or animated watermarks, which are ideal for identifying your work. Or quickly fix video problems by applying color correction, noise reduction, brightness, and contrast filters without leaving Compressor.\n\nDistributed Encoding\n\nBuilt into Compressor - Distributed encoding features are part of Compressor, with no need for a separate application.
