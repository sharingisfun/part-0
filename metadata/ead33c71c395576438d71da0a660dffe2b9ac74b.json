In place of the playboy he was, Oliver returned as a man bent on righting the wrongs of his family and those who had corrupted his city as a hooded vigilante.\n\nAfter failing to stop Malcolm Merlyn from destroying the Glades and the death of his best friend Tommy Merlyn, Oliver abandoned his hood out of guilt. But now, Oliver is forced to return to save both his family's company and his family, as Starling City has fallen into further ruin since the Undertaking. With allies; John Diggle and Felicity Smoak, Oliver will fight to honor his best friend as The Arrow, all the while on the run from his former ally; Laurel Lance. \n\nDuring the flashbacks Oliver is forced to deal with Dr. Ivo in his quest to find the Mirakuru, a strength enhancing serum created by the Japanese in World War II which results in Shado's death but is also reunited with Sara Lance while dealing with Slade who has been injected with the serum.\n\nIn the present day Oliver, Diggle and Felicity fight the minions of Sebastian Blood and his cult who have also found the Mirakuru while also taking down villains causing chaos in the Glades, occasionally with Sara aka The Canary and now has the support of Quinten Lance and Barry Allen, while in his regular life deals with the trial of his mother Moira who is eventually aquited of the charges. Meanwhile Roy continues to act outside as his own vigilantie and is also injected with the serum of Brother Blood while Thea and their friend Sin help him.\n\n\nStars: Stephen Amell,David Ramsey,Emily Bett Rickards,Katie Cassidy,Paul Blackthorne,Willa Holland,Colton Haynes,Manu Bennett,Susanna Thompson \n\n\nEpisode List:\n\n# \tEpisode name \t              Original airdate\n\n1 \tCity of Heroes \t              October 9, 2013\n2 \tIdentity \t              October 16, 2013\n3 \tBroken Dolls \t              October 23, 2013\n4 \tCrucible \t              October 30, 2013\n5 \tLeague of Assassins \t      November 6, 2013\n6 \tKeep Your Enemies Closer      November 13, 2013\n7 \tState v.
