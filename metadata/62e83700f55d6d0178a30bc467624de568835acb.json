  "description": "Tony Robbins, Money master the game audio book ( Sharing, as I don't believe it's on Pirate??? )\r\n\r\n\r\nremember, results don't come without action.. never go forward unless you've done the homework for the session.. trust me, I use to listen to Tony Robbins and nothing changed till I took the time to do what he said.. PAUSE if you have to and grab that pen and paper, and make magic happen. You will never get a result unless you commit to doing what these masters are teaching, listening and hoping is not enough or as Tony Robbins says, then all kids would have a pony.. AND THEY DON&quot;T...\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are not getting the results you want, do a favor to yourself and listen to whatever program you are using over and over and over.. and over until you reprogram your subconscious for success.. you had a lifetime of poverty mentality, it will take a while to change that subconscious programming to wealth consciousnesses... listen to it every chance you get ( in the shower, in the car, when you wake up, eating, before bed, brushing teeth, ANYTIME YOU CAN, listen to it over and over till you start to see the shift.. it will come trust me, but be dedicated, as this is how Bob Proctor changed his life, and it's how you can too.. with repetition the results will come...) change is reserved for those dedicated to making that change that only you have the power to do\r\n\r\nhope to see you in the winners circle.. it's reserved for those special few that really want change, and will do anything for it, this information does work if you are ready to accept the challenge..\r\n\r\nN O    M A T T E R     W H A T    S T A N D S    I N    T H E    W A Y \r\n\r\nI will be uploading more from Sonia and Bob proctor..some packs from T harv and such.... stay tuned. so please if you like buy a program that is not on here and share.. I know it's a lot of money, but not if you think that it will create you as much wealth as you want.. the knowledge is priceless.. stop drinking those lattes for a couple months or make lunch for work and you'll have enough money for these programs.. it's how I bought you these.. get creative and ask yourself.. what can I do to get this money for these programs that will change my life",
