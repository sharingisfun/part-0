  "description": "\nStill Well Angel was formed by twin brothers Singer/Guitarist Sean and Drummer Stephen Chicarello. Gathering some friends to play the bass and guitar they started hitting the local scene hard playing local festivals such as Hemp Fest, Laconia Bike Week, Charlestown Music Fest, Controlled Chaos Arts &amp; Music Festival and New England Punk, Goth, and Metal Fest. After a few months of performing the bands local status started to grow and lead the band to share the stage with national recording artists Powerman 5000, Ra, Adema, The Misfits, Nonpoint, Nullset, Tantric and Drowning Pool.\n\n\nIn the fall of 2010 they decided to head to the studio to record a 6 song EP, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Khaos is ComingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. They took the winter months to record and in February 2011 released their EP, with great success. They returned to the big stage with Hinder and Saving Abel and toured New England promoting their EP. That summer they also got to share the stage with national artists, Candlebox, Alterbridge, and Theory of a Deadman. In the fall of 2011, to help promote their upcoming Halloween show with Hed PE, the guys partnered with local radio station CNEU to do a meet and greet with fans and live interview. In October Still Well Angel was named CNEUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Band of the MonthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n\nBand: Still Well Angel\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal/Hard Rock\nCountry: US\nYear: 2015\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nPlaytime: 42:20\nSize: 98.8 MB\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
