  "description": "Overview:\n=========\n\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) will expand upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago.\n\nCS: GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust, etc.).
