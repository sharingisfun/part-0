  "description": "Presenting the best discography of Jamiroquai that has ever been uploaded! This collection is all you need, there is all the main albums plus a couple of official live albums and the greatest hits. I have very carefully put this whole thing together so that it is a quality torrent. All the tracks are in MP3 @ 320kbps CBR/44.1Khz. I have made the best discography I can for this band, you don't really need anything else.\n\nIf you want to know more about Jamiroquai then read about them on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamiroquai\n\nI like to upload funky bands and I think this one like some of my others are very funky. Jamiroquai are an acid jazz/funk band. I've listened to them for years now, I think the 3rd album was one of the first CDs I ever bought.\n\nI've tagged them all perfectly plus I've included the artwork. You can load them all straight onto your MP3 player and they should sound excellent.\n\nIf you do download this then please help to seed it. I've been trying to seed my torrents as much as possible, I'm hoping that this one will become popular especially because I'm including all the live albums.\n\nHope you enjoy this release!\n\nReleases as follows:\n\n(1993) Jamiroquai - Emergency On Planet Earth\n(1994) Jamiroquai - The Return Of The Space Cowboy\n(1996) Jamiroquai - Travelling Without Moving\n(1999) Jamiroquai - Synkronized\n(2001) Jamiroquai - A Funk Odyssey\n(2005) Jamiroquai - Dynamite\n(2010) Jamiroquai - Rock Dust Light Star\n(2006) Jamiroquai - High Times (Singles 1992-2006)  CD 1\n(2006) Jamiroquai - High Times (Singles 1992-2006)  CD 2\n(2002) Jamiroquai - Live In Verona  CD 1\n(2002) Jamiroquai - Live In Verona  CD 2\n(2003) Jamiroquai - Live At Montreux 2003  CD 1\n(2003) Jamiroquai - Live At Montreux 2003  CD 2",
