  "description": "All episodes from all 9 seasons, 1-8 DVDRip, season 9 HDTV + all the extras. Please seed at a decent speed.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\nTSV.\n\n\n\n\nTwo and a Half Men is an American television sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 22, 2003. Starring Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones, the show was originally about a hedonistic jingle writer, Charlie Harper; his uptight brother, Alan; and Alan's growing son, Jake. Charlie's free-wheeling life is complicated when his brother gets divorced and moves, along with his son, into Charlie's beach-front Malibu house. The series' premise was revamped in the ninth season, focusing on Alan and Jake moving on with their lives after the death of Charlie with help from their new roommate, Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), who is also dealing with his own troubles following a bad divorce. The three eventually bond and help each other grow and overcome their losses.\n\nIn 2010, CBS and Warner Bros. Television reached a multi-year broadcast agreement for the series, renewing it through at least the 2011ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“12 season. However, CBS and Warner Bros. decided to end production for the rest of the eighth season due to Sheen entering drug rehabilitation and making &quot;disparaging comments&quot; about the show's creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre. Sheen was officially fired from the show on March 7, 2011. The ninth season premiere, &quot;Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt&quot;, killed off Sheen's character and introduced Ashton Kutcher as Walden Schmidt, his replacement.\n\nIn 2011, a news article in The New York Times called it &quot;the biggest hit comedy of the past decade.&quot;The show has ranked among the Top 20 programs every season since it first aired. There have been nine seasons of the show so far.  ",
