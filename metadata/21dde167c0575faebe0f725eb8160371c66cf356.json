  "description": "Description:\r\nBandicam is a simple to use tool that helps you record your game activity or capture screenshots that you can later share with anyone.\r\n\r\nBandicam consists of 2 modes. One is the 'DirectX/OpenGL window' mode, which can be used to record the target created in DirectX (or OpenGL), and the other is the 'Rectangle on a screen' mode, which can be used for recording a certain area on the PC screen. \r\n\r\nBandicam displays FPS numbers in the corner of the screen while it is active in the 'DirectX/OpenGL window' mode. The FPS numbers do not display when it is recorded in the 'Rectangle on a screen' mode. Bandicam supports various video codecs (MPEG-1, Motion JPEG, Xvid, YV12, and RGB24) and audio codecs (MPEG-1 L2 and PCM). \r\n\r\nThe Bandicam codec (Bandisoft MPEG-1 decoder) manages to capture videos with minimal impact on game (or other desktop applications) performance, as it has been optimized to achieve compression. \r\n\r\nBandicam is designed to be able to record video at HD resolutions on modern computers, including 720p (1280x720, 60 frame/s) and 1080p (1920x1080, 30 frame/s).
