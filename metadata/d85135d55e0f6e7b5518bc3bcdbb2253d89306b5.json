  "description": "*****(IMPORTANT, CRACK AND PATCH NOT INCLUDED******\n***** (CRACK DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO PLAY STRONGHOLD 2 ONLINE)*****\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n- Processor: 1.4GHz CPU or equivalent\n- RAM: 256 MB RAM\n- Video Memory: 32 MB VRAM\n- Hard Drive Space: 2500 MB\n- Operating System: Windows 95/98/2000/ME/XP\n- DirectX Version: v9.0c\nRecommended System Requirements\n- Processor: 2.0GHz CPU or equivalent\n- RAM: 512 MB RAM\n- Video Memory: 64 MB VRAM\n- Hard Drive Space: 2500 MB\n\n\nHow to install:\n\nAfter you have finished the download you need to mount the ISO file using (for example) daemon tools, available here at the piratebay: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3997540/DAEMON_Tools_Lite_4.11.2_-_TheOneX&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3997540/DAEMON_Tools_Lite_4.11.2_-_TheOneX&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is a software program that allows you to create a virtual drive. After you installed and started daemon tools you right click on the daemon tools icon on the taskbar and choose mount image. Then you browse to where you have saved the Stronghold ISO file. The ISO file should be mounted now and now you carry on as if you just inserted a CD in your drive so you click on start &gt; my computer &gt; and you will see Stronghold icon listed with your drives. Double click and install the game. After you installed the game you have to install the patch and apply the no cd crack. Available right here at the piratebay: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4569091/Stronghold_2_patch_crack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4569091/Stronghold_2_patch_crack&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe patch will update the game to version 1.4.1. this is a regular Windows install. if you then try to start the game you will find that you will get the error message stating: please insert the right CD to start the game. To correct that all you need to do apply the no CD crack which fools the software in thinking the right CD is in the drive. \n\nDrag and drop the no cd crack to the following location ( C:/Program Files/Firefly Studios/Stronghold 2). Windows will tell you that the file already exists but please carry on and save the no CD crack over the old one. Once thats done all you need to do double click the shortcut on your desktop and play the game! \n\nif you do not get the message &quot;file already exists&quot;, you've done it wrong! make sure you DO NOT open the Stronghold folder when you place the no cd crack there. Just drop the crack in the closed Stronghold 2 folder, thats all!\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME:\n\n1) The error message &quot;d3dx9_27.dll not found&quot;\n\nthis isnt really the game but a missing driver i think, i had this message once when i reinstalled Vista (grrrrrr, vista sucks!).\nits very easy to solve though, after asking google i found out that all you need to do is update or downgrade DirectX to version 9.\nDont ask me why but it solved the problem for me.\n\n***** I received some feedback regarding this issue from &quot;deathhall&quot;, he explained that: &quot;d3dx9_27.dll&quot; means direct X that's why it works to upgrade/downgrade&quot;. So at least we know it isn't really the game that is to blame :-) ************\n\n2) Sometimes when i use &quot;homemade maps&quot; from my other release the game just stops.\n\nThats because of bugs in the maps. as i said, they're homemade something must've gone wrong. i never had that happen to me while i was playing default maps. but nearly all maps work perfectly fine. \n\n3) Once I started the game the game will ask me to play or update the game and when i do the update i get the message right cd cannot be authenticated and i cant start the game.\n\nthe game is already updated to the latest (last) version/patch/update, when you re-install the update you overwrite the no cd crack so just re-install the no cd crack like described above and henceforth ignore the upgrade request within the game.\n \n***********If you tried al this and you can't get the game to work then you can send me an e-mail and I will do my best to help you!\nI can only help you if you tell me what error messages you get so be sure to add those! Also make sure you comply with the system requirements! ****************\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6115090411081300150405141502090c000f21090e150c00080d4f020e0c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEnjoy the game and once convinced go out and buy!\n==============================================================================\n\nBuild.
