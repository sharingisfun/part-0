The group is led by Rick Grimes, who was a sheriff's deputy in a small Georgia town, before the zombie outbreak. As their situation grows more and more grim, the group's desperation to survive pushes them to the brink of insanity. At every turn they are faced with unspeakable horrorsÃ¢â‚¬â€both from the dead, and from the scattered remains of a struggling human populace.\n\nWhen it becomes more and more obvious that their whole world is ravaged by the zombie apocalypse, the survivors struggle to stay alive and hold on to their humanity.\n\n***************************************\n\nThis Torrent includes the Webisodes of the short story Ã¢â‚¬Å“Torn ApartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which premiered on October 3, 2011 on AMC's official website, prior to the start of Season 2.\n\n***************************************\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=593210#pid593210&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=593210#pid593210&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD+x264\nFile size:  \t\t350 MiB (Xvid), 300 MiB (x264) avg. per episode \nDuration : \t\t43 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels (XviD), 720 (x264)\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels (XviD), 404 (x264)\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976 fps\nAudio:  \t\tMP3+AAC\nNr. of Files:\t\t13 Episodes + 6 Webisodes + 1 Trailer + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 22\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n                                      and the release groups\n2HD,ASAP,FQM,LOL,IMMERSE,FEVER,SYS,ORENJI,REWARD,SPASTiKUS,MiXED,MOMENTUM, and all the others (too many to mention them all)\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\nVisit the KABLAM!!! @ forum.suprbay.org\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
