  "description": "[b]&quot;Can't Hold Us&quot; is a song by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis featuring Ray Dalton taken from their collaborative album The Heist (2012). It was released as the third single from the album on August 16, 2011. The song also features additional vocals by actress Susannah Wetzel, who sings portions of the chorus alongside Dalton.\nThe song peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their second number one hit in the United States. It's also their third consecutive number-one single in Australia. In early 2013, the song was re-released and featured in a U.S. television commercial for Microsoft's Outlook.com webmail service and in commercials for the drink Miller. The song was also used in the background of ESPN College Gameday commercials and in the March 2013 premiere episode of MTV's The Real World: Portland.\nThe radio edit cuts out portions of the introduction, as well as the extended bridge section and an alternate beat during the last chorus. The beat is similar to their live performances of the song.[/b]",
