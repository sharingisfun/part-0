  "description": "All episodes from all 8 seasons DVDRip + all the extras, interviews, behind the scenes etc.\n\nPlease seed at a decent speed for as long as possible and help keep this excellent show alive.\n\nHouse (also known as House, M.D.) is an American television medical drama that originally ran on the Fox network for eight seasons, from November 16, 2004 to May 21, 2012. The show's main character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), a drug-addicted, unconventional, misanthropic medical genius who leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional PrincetonÃ¢â‚¬â€œPlainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The showÃ¢â‚¬Â²s premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character. The showÃ¢â‚¬Â²s executive producers include Shore, Attanasio, AttanasioÃ¢â‚¬Â²s business partner, Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was filmed largely in Century City.\n\nHouse often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patientsÃ¢â‚¬Â² illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). House's only true friend is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), head of the Department of Oncology. During the first three seasons, House's diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy &quot;Thirteen&quot; Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn). Kutner makes his final appearance late in season five. Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in season six. Cameron then departs the hospital, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team. Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of season seven, and her position is filled by medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn). Cuddy and Masters depart before season eight; Foreman becomes the new dean of medicine, while Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi) join HouseÃ¢â‚¬Â²s team.\n\nHouse was among the top-ten rated shows in the United States from its second through its fourth season. Distributed to 66 countries, House was the most watched television program in the world in 2008. The show received numerous awards, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, and nine People's Choice Awards. On February 8, 2012, Fox announced that the eighth season, then in progress, would be HouseÃ¢â‚¬Â²s last. The series finale aired on May 21, 2012, following an hour-long retrospective.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nTSV.",
