Paris\r\nHardcover: 304 pages\r\nPublisher: St. Martin's Press (August 9, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1250121000\r\nISBN-13: 978-1250121004\r\nFormat: ePub, Mobi, azw3\r\n\r\nEveryone knows a couple like Jack and Grace. He has looks and wealth; she has charm and elegance. HeÃ¢Â€â„¢s a dedicated attorney who has never lost a case; she is a flawless homemaker, a masterful gardener and cook, and dotes on her disabled younger sister. Though they are still newlyweds, they seem to have it all. You might not want to like them, but you do. YouÃ¢Â€â„¢re hopelessly charmed by the ease and comfort of their home, by the graciousness of the dinner parties they throw. YouÃ¢Â€â„¢d like to get to know Grace better.\r\n\r\nBut itÃ¢Â€â„¢s difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are inseparable.\r\n\r\nSome might call this true love. Others might wonder why Grace never answers the phone. Or why she can never meet for coffee, even though she doesnÃ¢Â€â„¢t work. How she can cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim. Or why she never seems to take anything with her when she leaves the house, not even a pen. Or why there are such high-security metal shutters on all the downstairs windows.\r\n\r\nSome might wonder whatÃ¢Â€â„¢s really going on once the dinner party is over, and the front door has closed.\r\n\r\nFrom bestselling author B. A. Paris comes the gripping thriller and international phenomenon Behind Closed Doors",
