But what resonates so deeply is Noel's ability to frame the vulnerability, isolation and courage of people persevering in one of the world's harshest landscapes.\r\nThe restoration by the BFI National Archive has transformed the quality of the surviving elements of the film and reintroduced the original coloured tints and tones. The original silent film is brought to life as never before by a haunting new soundtrack composed by Simon Fisher Turner. Revealed by the restoration, few images in cinema are as epic - or moving - as the final shots of a blood red sunset over the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/The-Epic-of-Everest-BBC-1080p-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~3174Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 4:3\r\n * Video Resolution: 1440x1080 (B&amp;W)\r\n * Frame Rate: 24 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~140Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 86 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Part Size: 2 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b050r7gx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a09989c0c048711bc86c0f8ca609c981a04e5f52","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Epic+of+Everest+1080p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a09989c0c048711bc86c0f8ca609c981a04e5f52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,153,137,192,192,72,113,27,200,108,15,140,166,9,201,129,160,78,95,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
