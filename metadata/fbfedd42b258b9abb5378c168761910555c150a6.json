  "description": "\n\n\nAerosmith\nGreatest Hits (2008)\n\n\n\n\nAerosmith was one of the most popular hard rock bands of the '70s, setting the style and sound of hard rock and heavy metal for the next two decades with their raunchy, bluesy swagger. The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Devil's Got A New Disguise\n02.Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\n03.I Don't Want To Miss A Thing (Pop Mix)\n04.Jaded\n05.Janie's Got A Gun\n06.Walk This Way (With Run D.M.C.)\n07.Crazy\n08.Hole In My Soul\n09.Love In An Elevator\n10.Pink\n11.Cryin'\n12.Rag Doll\n13.The Other Side\n14.Amazing\n15.Livin' On The Edge\n16.Girls Of Summer\n17.Lay It Down\n18.Just Feel Better (Feat.
