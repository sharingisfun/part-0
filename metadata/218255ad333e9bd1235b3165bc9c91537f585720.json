The techniques described can achieve a stretch of the intended muscle/muscle group without involving surrounding ligaments and stretching them to extremes. This is of great importance for the lower back, which can easily cause pain when being stretched in an incorrect way.\n\nThe exercises are described with an easy-to-understand text without medical terms and they are supplemented by showing the most common errors while performing the stretch and how to avoid them. \n\nEach exercise is illustrated with drawings which clearly depict the origin and insertion of the muscle . There are also one or more drawings of the stretch itself, and an anatomical picture of the muscles involved in the stretch.\n\n=============================================\n\nStretching Scientifically: A Guide to Flexibility Training \n\nPublisher: Stadion Publishing Co; 4th edition\n2003\nThomas Kurz \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0940149451\nISBN-13: 978-0940149458\n214 Pages\nPDF\n23.1 MB\n\nUse our method to attain maximum height in your kicks and to be able to kick at that height with no warm-up! \n\nLearn: \n* How to stretch safely and quickly to achieve and maintain your maximum flexibility \n* How to make your muscles grow stronger and longer so you stay flexible all the time \n* How to do splits even if you are over 40 or 50 \n* How to kick high and do splits with no warm-up \n* How to develop each of the three kinds of flexibilityÃ¢â‚¬â€dynamic, static active and static passiveÃ¢â‚¬â€to suit every athlete's needs \n* What exercises are &quot;no-no's&quot; if you want to stretch your muscles \n* All the factors limiting flexibility \n* Brilliantly simple tests of hip joint mobility and muscle length that dispel common misconceptions of what limits flexibility the most\n\n=======================================\n\nStretching &amp; Flexibility \n\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Australia; 1 edition \nKit Laughlin \n2000\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0743200691\nISBN-13: 978-0743200691\n280 Pages\nPDF\n53.3 MB\n\nThis work is based on the posture and flexibility classes the author has run for many years at the Australian National University Union.

R. Kumar\n1987 \nEnglish\nISBN: 0862494605 \nPDF \n195 pages \n20.9 MB\n\nYoga, especially Hatha Yoga, is now a craze both in India and abroad. Many books on the subject dealing with various aspects of Yoga and catering to a variety of needs and tastes have hit the stands during the past decade. I have known the author, E. R. Ram Kumar, as an excellent writer, having read his many and varied articles, some of them falling in my area of professional interest: health. What indeed came as a surprise to me as I pored through the MS, was the refreshingly new angle and approach Mr. Ram Kumar has adopted for his book. I was impressed by the depth of knowledge he has acquired in the study of human anatomy and the many diseases our body is vulnerable to.\n\n\n",
