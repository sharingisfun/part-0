Hive\r\n\r\nCM8 Doing It Right The First Time\r\n\r\nSource: DVD-Screener Big THX m8\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nDVDScreener 15\r\n\r\nwe held back this title till 1 week after cinema premiere to give the movie a fighting chance to play in the budget, we learned from our mistake\r\n\r\nStatement:\r\n\r\nWe didnt plan to comment at all on recent events, but we feel now that we should.\r\n\r\nSorry to disappoint M but there was no hack or any such thing . we got the copies sold from a guy on the street, no decryption was needed. we were definately not the only ones.\r\ncpl other movies have been on the net days before, not done from us\r\nSo we wanted to share this movies with the people who are not rich enough or not able to watch all nominated movies in the cinema.\r\n\r\nOf course this files are not representing the movies how they can be enjoyed in the cinema\r\n\r\nAs said in our nfo, please support the producers and watch all movies in the cinema on a big screen, like you should do anyhow.\r\nThe Producers need the money from ticket sales to get back the production costs.\r\n\r\nAs for Hateful Eight Movie:\r\n\r\nWe feel sorry for the trouble we caused by releasing that great movie before cinedate even has begun.\r\nwe never intended to hurt anyone by doing that, we didnt know it would get that popular that quickly\r\n\r\nThe Hateful Eight is an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and a memorable score.\r\nAll of those elements make The Hateful Eight an unforgettable film that is Quentin Tarantino at his best.\r\n\r\nSince everyone is now talking about this movie we dont think the producers will loose any money at cinedate, and we tell you now why.\r\nwe actually think this has created a new type of media hype that is more present in the news,radio and in the papers than starwars, and the promotional costs for this were free\r\n\r\nIf lets say 5% of the people planned to watch this movie at cinemadate, due to this media push we unintenionally created, we believe that now 40% of the people will watch this movie in the cinema\r\ncause everyone is talking about it and everyone wants to see the movie that created so much noise.\r\nthis will push the cinema tickets sale for sure.\r\n\r\nwe really hope this helped out the producers in the longrun, so that the production costs are covered and more\r\n\r\nwe also think that the hateful 8 movie is the top candidate for the awards and will win by a mile over others\r\nthx tarantino for this wonderful movie\r\n\r\nsorry it was around christmas we didnt plan that at all either, we wont do another movie before its cinedate,\r\nand we def wont go up to 40 as planned, we think we have done enough already.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n\r\nEncode:\r\n\r\nquality was ok on this.\r\n\r\ngot very nice\r\nenjoy\r\n\r\nVideo: 720x288 @bitrate 1400 2pass\r\nAudio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo\r\nSample: yes
