Like much painting, sculpture and engraving, since its beginning photography has also been at the service of eroticism. This collection presents erotic photographs from the beginning of photography until the years just before World War II. It explores the evolution of the genre and its origins in France, and its journey from public distrust to the large audience it enjoys today.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2847df4e5f1183443ef9d0b157a6c99b09fd62","amp;dn":"Erotic+Photography+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2847df4e5f1183443ef9d0b157a6c99b09fd62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,40,71,223,78,95,17,131,68,62,249,208,177,87,166,201,155,9,253,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
