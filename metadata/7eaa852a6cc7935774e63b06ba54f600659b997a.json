  "description": "http://ititli.com/images/b1zIq.jpg\r\n\r\nDSLR photography requires more knowledge than taking pictures with your phone. Your phone is great for taking pictures, it is always available, and it weighs less than a pound. Something wonderful takes place and you can just whip out that phone, point and shoot! If you have fallen in love with photography and want to graduate to DSLR, you will need a bit of learning to get you started. The photos you will produce with your DSLR will have a quality that cannot be matched by a point and shoot phone. Your hobby is about to get more involved and you will be amazed with the pictures you create.\r\n\r\nPhotography: The Beginners Crash Course in DSLR Photography\r\nEnglish | 1 Sept. 2016 | ISBN: 1537427296 | 34 Pages| PDF/ePUB/MOBI/AZW3 | 417KB/78KB/170KB/175KB",
