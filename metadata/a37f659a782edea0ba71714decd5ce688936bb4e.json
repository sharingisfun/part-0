  "description": " David Deida, &quot;The Way of the Superior Man : A Man's Guide to Mastering the Challenges of Women, Work, and Sexual Desire&quot;\n1997 | ISBN: 1889762105 | 121 pages | PDF | 3,6 MB\n\nThe Way Of The Superior Man takes the reader on a powerful journey into the heart of the contemporary masculine experience. With uncommon honesty and unparalleled insight into the deepest desires of the masculine heart, David Deida explores the most challenging and important issues in men's lives. Covering everything from work and career, to dealing with sex, women, and love, to finding purpose in an increasingly superficial and mechanical world, The Way Of The Superior Man reveals how a man can live a life of fulfillment without compromise by relaxing into the truth of his very being, discovering his deepest vision, and giving his gifts without holding anything back. What emerges is a wholly revolutionary look at what it means to be a man in today's world, as well as an astonishingly practical guidebook to living a masculine life of integrity, authenticity, and freedom. The Way Of The Superior Man is an articulate, insightful, inspiring, and invaluable contribution to today's national dialogue on the proper role of men in an egalitarian and nondiscriminatory society and within traditional and nontraditional families",
