He is married to Francine Smith, a ditzy housewife who is trying to make up for a wild youth. Their two children are Hayley, a passionately liberal college-aged activist, and Steve, a nerdy, wimpy high schooler who constantly attempts to live up to Stan's expectations. The Smith family is also in possession of two bizarre nonhumans ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Roger, an escaped alien from Area 51 whom Stan is covertly housing in defiance of his employer, and Klaus, an anthropomorphic goldfish whom the CIA implanted with the brain of an East German Olympic ski jumper.\nThe Smith Family resides on 43 Cherry Street in the fictional community of Langley Falls, Virginia in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The town name is a composite of Langley and Great Falls, two unincorporated communities located in Fairfax County.\nPlots generally center on the misadventures of various family members in their respective realms. Recurring themes include Stan's desire to see Steve mature properly, Roger's desires to establish a life outside of the house, Francine's desire of breaking out of an overly structured lifestyle, Hayley's desire to rebel against her father's politics and Steve's desire to finally become one of the cool kids and 'get some boob'. Stan's Conservatism is treated as buffoonish and self-abnegating on its face.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=629376#pid629376&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=629376#pid629376&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t175 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t22 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t        16:9\nFrame rate : \t        23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t19 + 2 Trailer + 1 TitlePic + 1 txt = 23\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce03d6000b0bed75b44fea21a5dd376827a82f6","amp;dn":"American+Dad+-+Season+6+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce03d6000b0bed75b44fea21a5dd376827a82f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,224,61,96,0,176,190,215,91,68,254,162,26,93,211,118,130,122,130,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
