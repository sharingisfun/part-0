  "description": "Welcome everybody.\n\nAssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed Rogue-Black Box\n\n1.Unrar.\n2.Mount or Burn.\n3.Run 'Setup.exe'.\n4.Start the game from Desktop.\n5.Support game developers like we do. \n\n\nAssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed: Rogue is another installment in extremely popular series of action-adventure games created by Ubisoft (creators of Prince of Persia, Rayman, Far Cry and other series). It was developed by studio Ubisoft Sofia in cooperation with UbisoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teams in Singapore, Montreal, Quebec, Chengdu, Milan and Bucharest.\n\nAction takes place in the middle of 18th century, during The Seven YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War. We play as Shay Patrick Cormac Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a Templar who once belonged to Assassin Brotherhood but started hunting for his former Ã¢â‚¬Å“brothersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ after he was betrayed. With progression of the story, we are visiting three major regions: New York, Appalachian Mountains and north waters of Atlantic Ocean. The game is final part of the KenwaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ story told previously by AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed III and AssassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creed IV: Black Flag.\n\nNFO",
