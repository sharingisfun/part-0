The series premiered September 26, 2001 on the UPN television network with the final episode airing on May 13, 2005.\n\nThe show is set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy around the year 2150, nearly one century before the original Star Trek series, aboard the starship Enterprise NX-01, Earth's first warp 5 capable ship which was designed for long-range exploration of the galaxy and captained by Jonathan Archer. The NX designation indicates that this Enterprise is an experimental prototype.\n\n\n\nPlease seed at a decent speed.\n\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\n\nTSV.",
