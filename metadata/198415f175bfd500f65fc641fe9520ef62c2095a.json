Sealed inside a giant wall, the lowlife occupants of District 13 are ruled by the drug-addled comedy gangster Taha (Bibi Naceri) and his motley crew of Goldie Lookin? Chain rejects. When the dimwits mysteriously acquire a massive bomb and trip the 24-hour fuse, elite cop Damien (Rafaelli) teams up with local resident and crime stopper LeÃƒÂ¯to to save the day.\n\n&quot;A SUPER-SIZED DIET OF INCREDIBLE ACTION&quot;\n\nWith a sub A-Team plot and acting that makes the Teletubbies look like a Chekhov play, District 13 survives solely on its super-sized diet of incredible action and pounding beats. Both Raffaelli and Belle (the latter Parkour?s inventor) execute their own stunts, which gives the film a non CG-enhanced realism, stylishly captured by first-time director Pierre Morel. Instantly forgettable, but hugely entertaining for 85 minutes.\n\nA good action flick, 14 May 2006\n\nAuthor: MrVibrating from Sweden \n\nWhat is there to like about this movie? Well, the plot is pretty good, even though I&amp;#039;d have much more trouble suspending my disbelief if it would not have been French. In the wake of all the ruckus in France, this movie feels pretty realistic as a social commentary.\n\nThe stunts(Parkour) are amazing. Smooth, fluid motion and crisp, no-bullshit camera-work makes it a real treat to the eye. The fighting scenes are cool too, and they at least partially real(for unreal, watch Hard Target or any other Van Damme movie. For real, watch Heat) and not as repetitive and drawn-out as the usual ones.\n\nThe whole ghetto atmosphere works really well. Concrete and poverty works fine as scenery. Dialouge seemed good too from what I got from the subtitles.\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s there to dislike? Well, character development is the same-old. Two different guys team up and saves the day, overcome their differences and live happily ever after. It has been done before, but at least it&amp;#039;s done well here.\n\nThe music is consistent and fitting, so that&amp;#039;s more of a matter of taste.\n\nOtherwise, the movie is pretty much solid. Minor flaws, but on the whole a treat from the moment it starts to the end. Not something you add to the DVD collection, maybe, but certainly worthwhile. -7/10",
