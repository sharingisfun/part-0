  "description": "Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 2015.017.20053 Multilingual | 752.79 MB\r\n\r\nAcrobat DC (former Adobe Acrobat XI Pro) is the completely reimagined desktop version of the worldâ€™s best PDF solution. It includes a mobile app so you can fill, sign and share PDFs on any device. And with Document Cloud services, you can create, export, edit and track PDFs from anywhere â€” and stay connected to recent files across all your devices.\t\r\n\r\nClean feature lineup\r\nThe application allows you to write down comments and feedback using a separate frame in the right side of the window, while the reading space is not affected at all.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is one of this tool's strong points: the interface is quite clean, but still manages to provide a lot of tools for zooming, selecting text, printing, adding bookmarks and many others.\r\n\r\nSupported file formats and fast searches\r\nA great thing about Adobe Reader XI is its ability to work with CAD designs and geospatial maps converted to Portable Document Format. Also, in case you need to locate any element within a PDF file, the application offers a comprehensive file searching engine that finds what you need in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nSecurity tools\r\nThe security functions enable you to view and work with PDF documents without having to worry about malicious code being executed on your machine. The 'Protected Mode' and the 'Enhanced Security' features are designed to safeguard your computer and provide data protection and privacy.\r\n\r\nConfiguration settings\r\nWhen it comes to customizing Adobe Reader XI, the Preferences area will give you the possibility to modify a wide range of settings. Comments, 3D and multimedia, measuring and reading options are available, as well as spelling or page units configurations.\r\n\r\nIn case you find Adobe Reader XI too difficult to use, the application includes a comprehensive help manual. Unfortunately you will need an Internet connection to access it, which means you won't be able to read the documentation in offline mode.\r\n\r\nA top PDF viewer on the market\r\nAll things considered, with this software app you can't get it wrong simply because it still sets the standards insofar as PDF documents are concerned. Adobe Reader XI really works as advertised and is the leading tool for viewing Portable Document Format files",
