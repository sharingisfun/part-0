Enya is an approximate transliteration of how Eithne is pronounced in the Gaoth Dobhair dialect of the Irish language, her native tongue.\nShe began her musical career in 1980, when she briefly joined her family band Clannad, before leaving to perform solo. She gained wider recognition for her music in the 1986 BBC series The Celts. Shortly afterwards, her 1988 album Watermark propelled her to further international fame and she became known for her unique sound, characterised by voice-layering, folk melodies, synthesised backdrops and ethereal reverberations.\nShe continued to enjoy steady success during the 1990s and 2000s; her 2000 album A Day Without Rain sold 15 million copies and she was named the world's best selling female artist of 2001. She is Ireland's best-selling solo musician and is officially the country's second-largest musical export after the band U2. Her album sales were more than 75 million worldwide, with over 26 million in album sales in the US. Her work has earned her four Grammy awards and an Academy Award nomination. She has performed works in 10 languages.\n\n.: Enya :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/8094/enya1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/8094/enya1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1987 Enya @320\n1989 Watermark @320\n1991 Shepherd Moons @320\n1992 The Celts (Enya Remastered) @320\n1995 The Memory Of Trees @320\n2000 A Day Without Rain @320\n2005 Amarantine @320\n2005 Amarantine Special Christmas Edition (2CD) @320\n2008 And Winter Came... @320\n\nCompilation albums\n1997 Paint The Sky With Stars (The Best Of Enya) @320\n2002 Best Of Enya @320\n2009 The Very Best of Enya (Deluxe Edition) @320\n\nBox Set\n1997 Box Of Dreams (3 CD) @320\\CD1 Oceans\n1997 Box Of Dreams (3 CD) @320\\CD2 Clouds\n1997 Box Of Dreams (3 CD) @320\\CD3 Stars\n2002 Only Time - The Collection (Box set, 4 CD) @320\n\nOther albums\n1985 The Frog Prince (SoundTrack) @320\n1989 Storms In Africa (Single) @320\n1994 The Christmas (EP @320\n1996 On My Way Home (Maxi Single) @320\n2001 May it be (EP) @320\n2002 May it be (bootleg) @320\n2004 Enya B-sides &amp; Remixes @320\n2005 Amarentine (Maxi Single) @320\n2006 Enya Sounds Of The Season (EP) @320\n\nTribute albums\n2001 Oceans - The String Quartet Tribute to Enya @320\n2001 Perfect Panpipes - Performed By Guillermo Sanchez @320\n2002 Neora - Tribute to Enya @320\n2005 A Tribute Performed By China Roses (2 CD) @320\n2006 Taliesin Orchestra - The Music of Enya @320\n2007 The Best Of Enya On Piano @320\n2007 VA-Panpipes Plays Songs of Enya (2 CD) @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd3427aea1172ceb36b25c722fae2f627a2373c","amp;dn":"Enya+-+Discography+1985-2009+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd3427aea1172ceb36b25c722fae2f627a2373c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,211,66,122,234,17,114,206,179,107,37,199,34,250,226,246,39,162,55,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
