  "description": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail is a 1975 comedy film written and performed by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), and directed by Gilliam and Jones. It was conceived during a gap between the third and fourth seasons of their popular BBC television series Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nIn contrast to the group's first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, a compilation of sketches from the television series, Holy Grail was composed of original material, therefore considered the first &quot;proper&quot; film according to the group and mainstream audiences. It generally spoofs the legends of King Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail. The film was a success on its initial run and remains popular to this day. Idle used the film as the inspiration for the 2005 Tony Award-winning musical Spamalot.\n\nDirected by\t  :Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones\nStarring\t  :Graham Chapman, John Cleese,Terry Gilliam\n                  :Eric Idle, Terry Jones,Michael Palin\nRelease date(s)\t  :United Kingdom:3 April 1975\n                  :United States,10 May 1975\nRunning time\t  :Original release,87 min.\n                  :2001 rerelease,88 min.\n------------------\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 31mn 31s 491ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : DVD5\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Comedy\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 931 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 352 (1.818) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 126 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb",
