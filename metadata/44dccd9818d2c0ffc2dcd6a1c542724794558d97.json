  "description": "Hi there,\nThis is my first torrent, so I hope it works properly.\nI&amp;#039;ve seen many of you asking for this, so here it is:\nStar wars galactic battlegrounds!\nI bought this game myself, and I&amp;#039;ve tested both the disks and the ISO files.\nEverything works.\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n                     STAR WARS: GALACTIC BATTLEGROUNDS SAGA\n\nThe destiny of a galaxy hangs in the balance. You must lead the great armies of the STAR WARS saga in intense real-time strategy clashes across land, sea and air. Execute single or multiplayer battles as you deploy your armies and manage your resources.\n\n\nPlay as eight different civilisations: The Rebellion, the Old Republic, the Trade Federation, the Separatists, the Empire, the Wookies, the Gungans and the royal Naboo.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis game works with every computer that works with Age of Empires II.\n\nI have not included a crack, because no one is needed.\nThis game is not no-cd, because I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s needed. You can surely find a patch, though.\n\nTo play:\n1. Mount in DAEMON tools or equivalent, or burn it to a CD.\n2. Install.\n3. Play.\n\nNote: Some people may have to open the contents of one of the disks (I&amp;#039;ve forgotten which one, I think it&amp;#039;s the install disk) and click the install.exe file in order to play the Clone Campaigns. I don&amp;#039;t know why this happens.\n \nContents of SWGB_S.rar:\nSWGB_INST.iso - Install disk\nSWGB_PLAY.iso - Play disk\n\nI will not be able to seed this 24/7, but I will try as much as I can.",
