  "description": "In between Dreams - Jack Johnson [2005] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/8683/inbetweendreamsjackjohn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/8683/inbetweendreamsjackjohn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \nBaJFFaaCd\n\nWikipedia - In Between Dreams is the third album by singer-songwriter Jack Johnson, released by Brushfire Records in the United States on March 1, 2005 (see 2005 in music). &quot;Banana Pancakes&quot; was written originally by Indian writer/singer Alanna Palladino. As of May 10, 2006, the album had sold 2.1 million copies in the United States\n\nAmazon.com Review By Aidin Vaziri - For a man who gets his biggest kicks surfing the waves and strumming his guitar on a lonely beach in native Hawaii, singer-songwriter Jack Johnson has carved out quite a remarkable career on the mainland. His 2003 album, On and On, debuted at No. 3 on The Billboard 200 and subsequently went platinum on the back of hit single &quot;The Horizon Has Been Defeated.&quot; The follow-up, meanwhile, seems destined to shine even brighter. The drifting chords and soft voice are still in place, only now Johnson's instinct for melody has sharpened alongside his ability to self-edit. These small concessions make third album, In Between Dreams, his most conspicuous, particularly on tracks like the three-minute relationship drama, &quot;Sitting, Waiting, Wishing,&quot; and &quot;Breakdown,&quot; a song he originally recorded for Handsome Boy Modeling School's White People album remade here to reveal its full stripped-down loveliness. Imagine all the coconuts it will buy.\n\nMacKenzie Wilson, All Music Guide - Singer/songwriter Jack Johnson writes songs that just feel good, sticking to an equation that combines his warm, relaxed voice with an acoustic guitar. That cozy formula made him a favorite among American college crowds, so it's no surprise that Johnson sticks with what he does best for his third album, In Between Dreams. Producer Mario Caldato, Jr. is back again, touching up Johnson's summery backdrop for another playful set of songs. The genre-blending charm and sweetness that fueled Brushfire Fairytales and On and On hasn't changed that much, but does it really have to? Johnson, alongside drummer Adam Topol and bassist Merlo Podlewski, makes safe records. While there isn't anything wrong with that, taking a few more risks sonically and lyrically wouldn't work against him. Tender moments such as &quot;If I Could&quot; and &quot;No Other Way&quot; showcase a more reserved side on In Between Dreams. Other highlights include the lullaby-like &quot;Breakdown&quot; and the bossa nova rhythms of &quot;Do You Remember.&quot; Whether he's singing about being in love -- which he does quite well on &quot;Better Together&quot; and &quot;Banana Pancakes&quot; -- or reflecting on its hardships, Johnson's laid-back approach is his biggest strength. In Between Dreams is a bit brighter and more upbeat, but his song remains the same.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Better Together            \t[03:27]\n[02] Never Know              \t[03:32]\n[03] Banana Pancakes         \t[03:11]\n[04] Good People             \t[03:28]\n[05] No Other Way           \t[03:09]\n[06] Sitting, Waiting, Wishing\t[03:03]\n[07] Staple It Together     \t[03:16]\n[08] Situations             \t[01:17]\n[09] Crying Shame           \t[03:06]\n[10] If I Could             \t[02:25]\n[11] Breakdown              \t[03:32]\n[12] Belle                  \t[01:42]\n[13] Do You Remember        \t[02:24]\n[14] Constellations         \t[03:21]\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:45m:18s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 121mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v7.2.0.35 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 01 March 2005\nRecord Company\t&gt; Bush Fire Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com&lt;/a&gt; [Go2 Website 4a Free Mp3 D/load Live In Concert @ 192kbs ] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_(musician)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_(musician)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.azlyrics.com/j/johnson.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.azlyrics.com/j/johnson.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ilike.com/artist/Jack+Johnson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ilike.com/artist/Jack+Johnson&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.muzu.tv/jackjohnson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.muzu.tv/jackjohnson&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n",
