  "description": "Hot Tub Time Machine 2 (2015) CAMRip [RUS]\n\nStoryline\n\nWhen Lou finds himself in trouble, Nick and Jacob fire up the hot tub time machine in an attempt to get back to the past. But they inadvertently land in the future with Adam Jr. Now they have to alter the future in order to save the past - which is really the present.\n\nReview by  kevrhon-1:\nSeriously, literally, the worst major release I've ever seen. I almost walked out. I never walk out.\n\nI saw the first one on cable and thought it was entertaining enough. It was simple, but funny and with heart. I can't even describe the sequel. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen most of the funniest bits. And much of what you see is tacked on at the end during the credits.\n\nYou'd think it's about a series of adventures where they hop back and forth through time trying to fix things or improve their lot in life or something. It's nothing like that. It's all about trying to solve a mystery that threatens the life of one of the main characters. But, you know, &quot;funny.&quot; The plot is mostly stitched together with juvenile off-color jokes. And not the good kind. Mostly references to male anatomy. Reading a page of posts here on the IMDb message boards is funnier than HTTM2.\n\nDuring the first 10 minutes, about half a dozen people at the screening I attended DID walk out. I stayed only because I'd driven over an hour to see it and paid for a full admission plus concessions. I was by God going to stay to the end. It was a very fidgety 90 minutes. I gave it a &quot;2&quot; here at IMDb, only because there were a couple of pretty good laughs.\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/ab11764d705afb2606a6cefcb679af6c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/ab11764d705afb2606a6cefcb679af6c.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/48be45572b90b258512043c21cc0339d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/48be45572b90b258512043c21cc0339d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i4.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/fe651c16725f15aadce443bfff501790.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i4.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/fe651c16725f15aadce443bfff501790.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/22a4a5058d78fab693608921ff560604.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.imageban.ru/out/2015/04/02/22a4a5058d78fab693608921ff560604.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSample: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sendfile.su/1103450&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sendfile.su/1103450&lt;/a&gt;",
