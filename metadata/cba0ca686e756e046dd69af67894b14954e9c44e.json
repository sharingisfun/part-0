  "description": "Native Instruments The Giant KONTAKT DVDR\n\nYou've never seen or heard a piano like this. THE GIANT captures the sound of the world's biggest upright piano to deliver something even bigger: An intense, dynamic playing experience with a sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing short of inspiring. From urban pop, film score pathos, soft piano ballads, driving rock riffs or dim jazzy timbres, the untreated sound of THE GIANT instantly satisfies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ straight out of the box. Add detailed control options and a dark, cinematic version of the instrument, and THE GIANTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctiveness is matched only by its versatility. Meet your new go-to piano for virtually any style.\n\nDark Alter Ego\nTHE GIANT is two instruments in one. A dark, cinematic alter ego, effectively a separate instrument alongside the main piano, offers an irresistible playground for sound design and dramatic effects. Create your own mix of unconventional, individually-sampled sound sources Ã¢â‚¬â€œ overtones, resonances, plucked strings, release sounds and special techniques such as piano hits, kicks, sweeps or scratches Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all directly and instantly playable from the interface, delivering professional results with a fast workflow. These avant-garde sounds are also enhanced with detailed control options and a dedicated FX convolution engine with over 100 special piano effect impulse responses.\n\nSize matters - the original piano\nThe original instrument is the Klavins Piano Model 370i. The 'i' stands for integrated - this huge upright piano is built into the wall of a room, effectively securing the soundboard. Over three meters high and weighing over two tons, the Klavins Piano Model 370i provides a soundboard that's roughly twice the size of a typical 9' concert grand piano soundboard.\n\nNote: Kontakt 5.0.2 required!\n\n",
