  "description": "DDR Presents\n\nA DDR EXCLUSIVE\n\nDetective Byomkesh Bakshy!(2015)\n(A film by Dibakar Banerjee)\n\npDVD rip - 720x288 (2.5:1)- 700 MB - x.265.AAC (Dolby II)\n\nHIGH EFFICIENCY VIDEO ENCODING (HEVC) \n\nSynopsis:\nKolkata 1943. Young Ajit Banerjee's father Bhuban Babu has disappeared and no one knows if he is dead or alive. Suddenly a young man from Monghyr turns up and thrusts himself into the case, and promises to find him. But the search does not stop at Bhuban and Byomkesh and Ajit are drawn into an intrigue that not just has international ramifications but endangers their lives as well..\n\nComments:\nAlthough it is claimed to be loosely based on three stories of Saradindu Bandyopadhyay (Satyanweshi, Pather Kanta &amp; arthamanartham), the resemblance is at best marginal. If you are looking for some similarities with the TV serial by Basu Chatterjee, you will find none. Instead you will find a completely different story which is entertaining by itself and therein lies the strength of Dibakar Banerjee's film.\n\nThis is as much a story of Calcutta in the 1940's with some stunning visuals and about two young men drawn into a web of intrigue and danger. There are twista and turns in the story, and it isn't your normal potboiler. It keeps you guessing and while the end is a trifle predictable and overtly melodramatic, it hodls your interest despite its length (all of 2 hrs in this pDVD.\n\n\nUploader's Notes:\nThis is a x.265/HEVC rip, which allows far greater compression than normal x.264/AVC. This 700 MB rip is of similar or higher quality than any 1/3 DVD x.264 rip.The 10-bit encoding also removes some blocking and gives better color transitions.\n\nThe original video had an ugly yellow tint that permeated across all the four episodes. I have tried to remove that tint and to bring back natural colours as far as possible. The restoration quality is uneven, as I have restored each episode separately (Actually the video was divided into 11 parts and each part restored individually)\n\nI have taken the liberty of muting the garish colours a bit and done a bit of shadow gaining to make the video look better. It won't be that evident from the stills. Please check the sample which is from the exact centre of the film\n\nBe aware though that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on any stand-alone device. You can only watch this on a computer. Be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC or Media Player Classic or SMPlayer. Earlier versions may not work\n\nthe pDVD is from an upload by Lingaa.
