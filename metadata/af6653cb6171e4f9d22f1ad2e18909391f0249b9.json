He isn't sure his &quot;perfect husband&quot; loves him, and if he's chosen the right career. Aging is something he never thought about, but now he is faced with making the rest of his life count and hopes his close friends can help. Realizing that he may only have about 35 years left, he must figure out his life to ensure happiness and fulfillment. Fate changes everything when he meets a 15-year younger man who shows him that age does not matter, and that maybe his future happiness is right in front of him. Based on the true story of filmmaker Jeff London and how after being single for 48 years, his life changed when he met the love of his life and found his true purpose. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af6653cb6171e4f9d22f1ad2e18909391f0249b9","amp;dn":"Best+Day+Ever+%282014%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af6653cb6171e4f9d22f1ad2e18909391f0249b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,102,83,203,97,113,228,249,210,47,26,210,225,137,9,57,31,2,73,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
