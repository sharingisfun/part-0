Rushed to a life boat with Paddy Button, the two children escape while their Father (and Uncle) are on another life boat. In the chaos following the life boats are separated. Paddy, Richard and Em find themselves with no food and no water stuck in the middle of no where. After some time the 3 come across an uncharted paradise, where Paddy quickly teaches the children fishing, hunting and building. after maybe a month or two Paddy gets very drunk off a barrel of rum found on the island when they first arrive, and drowns in the middle of the night. Em and Richard now alone and very scared move location and rebuild their island home. Many years later the 2 young teenagers have developed a very real home, but hormones and feelings between the 2 strain the friendship, until Richard who is still very determined to reach San Fransico is let down by Em when a ship passes by the Island and she does not light the signal fire. Throwing her out of the home they had built together Em attempts to survive on her own but is hurt. After Richard finds her dying realizes how he really feels for her and manages to save her. Nature runs its course and the friendship turns in to love as the couple learn about the facts of life, when Em has a baby and does not understand why.\n\n\nTAGLINE: \n\nA story of natural love. Two children shipwrecked alone on a tropical island. Nature is kind. They thrive on the bounty of jungle and lagoon. The boy grows tall. The girl beautiful. They swim naked over coral reefs. They run in a cathedral of trees. And the warm winds, the tropic moon, the silk sand conspire to enchant them. When their love happens, it is natural as the sea, and as powerful. Love as nature intended to be.\n\nTwo children shipwrecked alone on a tropical island. Nature is kind. They thrive on the bounty of jungle and lagoon. The boy grows tall. The girl beautiful.
