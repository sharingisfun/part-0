  "description": "About the Show\nHeading into its intense, spellbinding second season, hit psychological thriller THE FOLLOWING will catch up with a healthy and healed RYAN HARDY (Golden Globe Award winner and Emmy Award nominee Kevin Bacon) a year after the tragic events of last season. Following a horrific new murder spree, the FBI calls on Ryan and MIKE WESTON (Shawn Ashmore) to speak with the lone survivor, LILY GRAY (Connie Nielsen, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boss,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Law &amp; Order: Special Victims UnitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), in order to help them solve the case. Having worked tirelessly to rehabilitate his life, Ryan is reluctant to re-engage with the FBI. Instead, he proceeds with his own investigation behind closed doors, and finds a valuable ally in his niece, MAX HARDY (Jessica Stroup, Ã¢â‚¬Å“90210Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), an NYPD cop working in the Intel Division. Throughout the season, Ryan will cross paths with several complicated individuals, including MANDY LANG (Tiffany Boone, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beautiful CreaturesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and LUKE (Sam Underwood, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DexterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), which furthers his suspicion that JOE CARROLL's (James Purefoy) reign of terror is far from over.\n\nFrom creator/executive producer Kevin Williamson (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Vampire Diaries,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dawson's Creek,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ScreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ franchise), THE FOLLOWING was last season's No. 1 new series and the No. 1 broadcast drama among Adults 18-49.\n\nThe action began when notorious serial killer Joe Carroll escaped from death row. The FBI immediately contacted former agent Ryan Hardy to consult on the case, as he was the one responsible for Carroll's capture in 2003, after Carroll murdered 14 female students on the Virginia college campus where he taught literature. Ryan, working closely with an FBI team, quickly learned that they were up against not one, but a cult of killers. As unimaginable events continued to unfold, Ryan raced desperately to stop Carroll before his endgame reached its deadly conclusion. The explosive first season finale featured the highly anticipated face-off between Ryan and Carroll, ending in Carroll's seemingly ultimate demise.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING is from Bonanza Productions Inc. in association with Outerbanks Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television. The series is created, written and executive-produced by Kevin Williamson. Marcos Siega serves as an executive producer and director.\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nOverall bit rate : 1 390 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-03-05 04:42:52\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.6.0 ('The Edge Of The In Between') built on Dec 1 2013 17:55:00\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1951707e7159552d3728&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 14 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate : 1 010 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.046\nWriting library : x264 core 140 r2377kMod 1ca7bb9\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No",
