He arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss adapting the book to film\nUniversal Pictures secured the film rights in August 2007 after bidding against other major film studios \nIn re-enacting the events of Operation Red Wings, Berg drew much of his screenplay from Luttrell's eyewitness accounts in the book, \nas well as autopsy and incident reports related to the mission. After directing Battleship for Universal in 2012,\nBerg returned to work on Lone Survivor. Principal photography began in October 2012 and concluded in November after 42 days\nfilming took place on location in New Mexico, using digital cinematography. Luttrell and several other Navy SEAL veterans acted as technical advisors,\nwhile multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces aided the film's production.\nLone Survivor opened in limited release in the United States on December 25, 2013, before opening across North America on January 10, 2014\nto strong financial success and a generally positive critical response.
