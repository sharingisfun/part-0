  "description": "Bee Gees\nThe Ultimate Bee Gees (2009)\n\n\nNo popular music act of the '60s, '70s, '80s, or '90s attracted a more varied audience than the Bee Gees. Beginning in the mid- to late '60s as a Beatlesque ensemble, they quickly developed as songwriters and singers to create a style of their own that carried them from psychedelia to progressive pop. Then, after hitting a popular trough, they reinvented themselves as perhaps the most successful white soul act of all time. What remained a constant throughout their history is their extraordinary singing, rooted in three voices that were appealing individually and melded together perfectly.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nDisc 1\n01.You Should Be Dancing\n02.Stayin' Alive\n03.Jive Talkin'\n04.Nights On Broadway\n05.Tragedy\n06.Night Fever\n07.More Than A Woman\n08.Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)\n09.Spirits Having Flown\n10.If I Can't Have You\n11.Boogie Child\n12.Love You Inside Out\n13.You Win Again\n14.One\n15.Secret Love\n16.Alone\n17.Still Waters (Run Deep)\n18.This Is Where I Came In\n19.Spicks And Specks\n\nDisc 2\n01.How Deep Is Your Love\n02.To Love Somebody\n03.Words\n04.How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n05.Too Much Heaven\n06.Emotion\n07.Lonely Days\n08.Run To Me\n09.Love So Right\n10.For Whom The Bell Tolls\n11.I've Gotta Get A Message To You\n12.New York Mining Disaster\n13.Massachusetts\n14.I Started A Joke\n15.World\n16.First Of May\n17.Holiday\n18.Don't Forget To Remember\n19.Islands In The Stream\n20.Heartbreaker\n21.Guilty (Live)\n\nCheers!",
