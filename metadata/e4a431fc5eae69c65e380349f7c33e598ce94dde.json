  "description": "The 420 Gourmet - The Elevated Art of Cannabis Cuisine (2016) (Epub) Gooner \r\n\r\n\r\nPublisher: Harper Wave (28 July 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0062445057\r\nISBN-13: 978-0062445056\r\n\r\nThe foodies guide to cannabis: a smart, sophisticated, and beautifully illustrated cookbook for at-home chefs wanting to safely create and experience their own edibles.\r\n\r\nJeffThe420Chef is revolutionizing the world of edibles. He first began cooking with cannabis to help a close friend's mother manage the pain, nausea, and discomfort from her cancer treatments. Over time, he developed a specific process that effectively neutralizes the smell and taste of cannabis when infusing it into butters and oils, leading to a new understanding of edibles and their potential for medicinal use.\r\n\r\nIn The 420 Gourmet, JeffThe420Chef, combines his fun-loving approach to cooking with practical information about marijuanaâ€”including specific guidelines for safe dosing (along with a comprehensive dosage calculator), summaries of the principal strains and their typical effects, and details on the herbÃ¢Â€â„¢s medical and recreational benefits.\r\n\r\nJeff includes the step-by-step process for his signature â€œlight-tastingâ€ canna-butter and canna-oils, the secrets behind his outrageously delicious and truly unique recipes. Once you create these staple ingredients yourself, it is easy to incorporate cannabis into everyday dishesâ€”the â€œpot-sibilitiesâ€ are endless!\r\n\r\nFrom brunch and small plates to salads and gourmet dinnersâ€”and featuring gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, and kosher optionsâ€”The 420 Gourmet elevates the edible experience. And by following JeffÃ¢Â€â„¢s dosage guidelines, the culinary cannabis experience will no longer be limited to a single bite of a brownie. These mouthwatering recipes are fully adaptable to your goals, whether you need a full-course meal for nourishment and pain management or a quick snack to help you focus, relax, and enhance your creativity.\r\n\r\nThe 420 Gourmet will educate and entertain new and longtime cannabis users alike, while serving as the ultimate guide to cannabliss.\r\n\r\nJEFFTHE420CHEF started cooking and baking discreetly with cannabis for friends and celebrities who had medical issues ranging from insomnia to back pain to cancer. He now teaches his canna-butter class, â€œThe Art of Cooking with Marijuana,â€ across the country in medical and recreational states, and cooks for private parties in California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Washington, DC. He lives in Los Angeles",
