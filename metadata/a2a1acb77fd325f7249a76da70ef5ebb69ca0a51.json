  "description": "Look: A Practical Guide for Improving Your Observational Skills by James H. Gilmore\r\n2016 | ISBN: 1626342997 | English | 192 pages | MOBI/EPUB/AZW | 1.4 MB\r\n\r\nMastering the Way You See the World\r\nInspired by Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hats method, Jim Gilmore has created a unique and useful tool to help our ability to perceive. In his latest book, Look: A Practical Guide for Improving Your Observational Skills, Gilmore introduces the metaphor of ''six looking glasses.'' Each looking glass represents a particular skill to master in order to enhance the way we look at the world.\r\n\r\nThe six skills include binoculars, bifocals, magnifying glass, microscope, rose-colored glasses, and blindfold looking. Each looking glass provides an observational lens through which to see the world differently. This framework will help its users to:\r\n\r\nSee the big picture\r\nOvercome personal bias\r\nPinpoint significance\r\nBetter scrutinize numerous details\r\nUncover potential opportunities\r\nSee what's in the mind's eye\r\n\r\nThese varying perspectives offer myriad practical applications: They can help any executive, manager, or designer more richly observe customer behavior, philanthropists and policy makers more keenly identify human needs, and anyone else interested in innovative thinking to first ground their ideation in practical observation.\r\n\r\nGilmore helps readers grasp the Six Looking Glasses by including helpful everyday examples and practice exercises throughout. Put into practice, this method of looking will help you see the world with new eyes",
