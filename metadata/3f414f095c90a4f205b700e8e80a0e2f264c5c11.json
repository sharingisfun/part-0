As hardboiled protagonists go, this guy is loaded with awesome and I was well and truly won over by the end of Lee Child's debut novel. ReacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a former military police officer who is cucumber cool and carries himself with a calm, quiet stoicism that reminded me a lot of Shadow from Neil GaimanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s American Gods(another favorite character of mine). In typical hardboiled fashion, JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narration of the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s events is muted and almost detached. This emotionally restrained tone is employed even when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s describing scenes of grisly, gore filled carnage of which this book has plenty. He keeps his feelings in check and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t phase easily, even when scummy douchesacks intentionally strive to work themselves under his skin. That said, when the moment is right and Jack is required to muster his inner grim reaper against the human stains who have wronged him and his...man is it ever G-fucking-O time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5091.Lee_Child&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5091.Lee_Child&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\ngoogle sam2085 kickass to find my other torrents\n\nTo quicky convert between formats like MOBI, EPUB, AZW3, TXT or PDF\nuse http://calibre-ebook.com/download or http://www.online-convert.com/\n\nComment if you cannot find seeds!
