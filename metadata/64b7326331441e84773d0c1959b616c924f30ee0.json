Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing 11-minute ballad, &quot;Desolation Row&quot;. Critics have focused on the innovative way in which Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s &quot;started&quot; with this album. \n\nLeading with the hit single &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, the album features songs that Dylan has continued to perform live over his long career, including &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; and &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. He named the album after the major American highway which connected his birthplace, Duluth, Minnesota, to southern cities famed for their musical heritage, including St. Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, and the Delta blues area of Mississippi.\n\nHighway 61 Revisited peaked at number three in the United States charts and number four in the United Kingdom. The album was ranked number four on Rolling StoneÃ¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;   \t6:13\n02. \t&quot;Tombstone Blues&quot;   \t6:00\n03. \t&quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot;   \t4:09\n04. \t&quot;From a Buick 6&quot;   \t3:19\n05. \t&quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot;   \t5:58\n06. \t&quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot;   \t5:31\n07. \t&quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;   \t3:30\n08. \t&quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues&quot;   \t5:32\n09. \t&quot;Desolation Row&quot;   \t11:21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b7326331441e84773d0c1959b616c924f30ee0","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Highway+61+Revisited+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b7326331441e84773d0c1959b616c924f30ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,183,50,99,49,68,30,132,119,61,12,25,89,182,22,201,36,243,14,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
