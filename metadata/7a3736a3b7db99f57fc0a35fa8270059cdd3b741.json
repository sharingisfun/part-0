Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy, and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents&amp;#x27; disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr Curt Connors, his father&amp;#x27;s former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors&amp;#x27; alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a3736a3b7db99f57fc0a35fa8270059cdd3b741","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+SpiderMan+%282012%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a3736a3b7db99f57fc0a35fa8270059cdd3b741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,55,54,163,183,219,153,245,127,192,163,95,168,39,0,89,205,211,183,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
