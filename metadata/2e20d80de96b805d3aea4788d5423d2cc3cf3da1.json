  "description": "Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis (5th Ed)\r\nby Roxy Peck, Chris Olsen and Jay Devore\r\nCengage Learning  | January 2015 | ISBN-10: 1305115341 | 844 Pages | True PDF | 73.1 mb\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS introduces you to the study of statistics and data analysis by using real data and attention-grabbing examples. The authors guide you through an intuition-based learning process that stresses interpretation and communication of statistical information. Simple notation?Cincluding frequent substitution of words for symbols?Chelps you grasp concepts and cement your comprehension. You'll also find coverage of most major technologies as a problem-solving tool, plus hands-on activities in each chapter that allow you to practice statistics firsthand.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nRoxy Peck is Emerita Associate Dean of the College of Science and Mathematics and Professor of Statistics Emerita at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. A faculty member at Cal Poly from 1979 until 2009, Roxy served for six years as Chair of the Statistics Department before becoming Associate Dean, a position she held for 13 years. She received an M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Applied Statistics from the University of California, Riverside. \r\nChris Olsen taught statistics at George Washington High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for over 25 years as well as at Cornell College and Grinnell College. Chris is a past member (twice) of the AP Statistics Test Development Committee and has been a table leader at the AP Statistics reading for 11 years. He is a long-time consultant to the College Board and has led workshops and institutes for AP Statistics teachers in the United States and internationally. \r\nJay Devore is Professor Emeritus of Statistics at California Polytechnic State University. He earned his undergraduate degree in Engineering Science from the University of California at Berkeley, spent a year at the University of Sheffield in England, and finished his Ph.D. in statistics at Stanford University. Jay previously taught at the University of Florida and at Oberlin College and has had visiting appointments at Stanford, Harvard, the University of Washington, New York University, and Columbia University.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n1 The Role of Statistics and the Data Analysis Process 1\r\n2 Collecting Data Sensibly 29\r\n3 Graphical Methods for Describing Data 80\r\n4 Numerical Methods for Describing Data 152\r\n5 Summarizing Bivariate Data 202\r\n6 Probability 283\r\n7 Random Variables and Probability Distributions 352\r\n8 Sampling Variability and Sampling Distributions 437\r\n9 Estimation Using a Single Sample 461\r\n10 Hypothesis Testing Using a Single Sample 505\r\n11 Comparing Two Populations or Treatments 561\r\n12 The Analysis of Categorical Data and Goodness-of-Fit Tests 624\r\n13 Simple Linear Regression and Correlation: Inferential Methods 662\r\n14 Multiple Regression Analysis 702\r\n15 Analysis of Variance 732\r\n16 Nonparametric (Distribution-Free) Statistical Methods 16-1\r\nAppendix A: Statistical Tables 759\r\nAppendix B: References 779\r\nAnswers to Selected Odd-Numbered Exercises 783\r\nIndex 805\r\n \nhttps://s14.postimg.io/yi02napc1/Introduction_to_Statistics_and_Data_Analysis_5t.jpg",
