With more freedom, knowledge, and body awareness, today's woman knows better than to settle for predictable, performance-based sex. Tantric Secrets for Men offers everything a man needs to know in order to satisfy a woman's physical, emotional, and spiritual yearnings. Employing the ancient secrets of physical ecstasy, men learn to transform rote sex into passionate lovemaking, pleasure into ecstasy, and partnership into union.\n\n From the expert teachings of a committed couple practicing and teaching ecstatic sexuality in a modern-day context, men will learn how to satisfy a woman on the levels of body, heart, and soul--and how to bring themselves to new heights of ecstasy in the process. The authors draw upon time-honored tantric and Taoist practices and modern sexology that will enable couples to make love more frequently, achieve higher and prolonged states of orgasmic intensity, experience lovemaking as a sacred endeavor, and deepen loving relationships.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vATl093EL._SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vATl093EL._SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTantric Sex for Men: Making Love a Meditation \n\nPublisher: Destiny Books\nDiana Richardson, Michael Richardson\n2010 \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1594773114\nISBN-13: 978-1594773112 \n176 pages \nPDF\n1.16 MB\n\nA revolutionary approach to male sexuality offers the keys to achieving sexual fulfillment\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Teaches how to retain semen for increased vitality and longer lovemaking\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Explains the relationship-strengthening benefits of deep, sustained penetration\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes foreplay approaches and position sequences \n\nFulfilling sex nourishes love, increases vitality, and boosts mental health. Unfortunately, prevailing attitudes about male sexuality and what is good sex work against these innate features by focusing on the excitement of ejaculation as the one and only goal.\n\n Using the tantric guidelines they have practiced for more than 25 years, Diana and Michael Richardson show men how to move beyond their preconceptions of sex as a goal-oriented--and often unintentionally stressful--event so they can relax into sex as a meditative union of complementary energies. They explain how retaining semen allows for increased vitality and extended lovemaking sessions and show the relationship-strengthening benefits of deep, sustained penetration. They also explain how to perform soft penetration and how to avoid premature ejaculation.\n\nTantric Sex for Men includes tried-and-true foreplay approaches, diagrams of sexual position sequences, ways to increase sexual sensitivity through awareness, and how to have ecstatic experiences through reaching a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body on a sexually deeper level. The authors also demonstrate how the sexual organs can be used to heal both men and women physically, emotionally, and spiritually.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7e80210880ad725c0eb872d801e08d24043b91","amp;dn":"Tantric+Secrets+for+Men%3A+What+Every+Woman+Will+Want+Her+Man+to+K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7e80210880ad725c0eb872d801e08d24043b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,126,128,33,8,128,173,114,92,14,184,114,216,1,224,141,36,4,59,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
