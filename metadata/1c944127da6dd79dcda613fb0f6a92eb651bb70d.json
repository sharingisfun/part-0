  "description": "Many have died in the Australian bush who might have lived had they known the appropriate survival skills. Bushcraft covers all areas of survival and camping activities: making ropes and cords, building huts, camp craft, finding food and water, making maps, starting fires, tying knots, and fashioning hunting and trapping gearÃ¢â‚¬â€virtually every technique required to stay alive in the woods. With over 400 black-and-white illustrations and photographs, this book explains how to make use of natural materials found locally in any area, conserving instead of destroying native flora and fauna. It describes many of the skills used by primitive man, adding to these the skills necessary for modern manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survival, such as methods for determining time and direction.\n\nThe author, who popularized the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“bushcraft,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ claims its practice has many unexpected results. By developing adaptability and honing the five senses, it will also improve your self-esteem and your ability to overcome difficulties in everyday tasks. The practice of bushcraft encourages self-confidence and counters the narrowing influence of modern living by broadening your horizons. Bushcraft is a clear, accurate, and reliable resource for anyone who wishes to face nature on its own terms with just a knife and this book.\n\nBushcraft - The Ultimate Guide to Survival in the Wilderness\nBook Language: English \nPages: 352\nFile Type: Pdf, epub, mobi\nFile Size: 64.57 MB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DBGCbch.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DBGCbch.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
