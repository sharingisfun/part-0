Add a Pattern and open the naming window. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Small scrollbars in editors - Smaller scrollbar for the Piano roll, Event Editor, Playlist etc. See F10 &gt; General Settings. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Horizontal zoom - Improved Playlist, Piano roll &amp; Event Editor. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Improved memory management - Two changes have been made to lower demands on FL Studio's memory allocation. 1. 32 &amp; 64 Bit VST plugins can be opened in 'Bridged' mode. The maximum memory available to the plugin will be at least 2 Gb for 32 Bit Windows and up to 192 Gb depending on your version of 64 Bit Windows. 2. Audio Clips &amp; Sampler Channels Keep on disk option now opens the sample in a separate memory allocation. Each Audio Clip / Sampler Channel can now load a sample of at least 2 Gb for 32 Bit &amp; 64 Bit Windows versions. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Improved audio options - ASIO: 'Mix in bufferswitch' and 'Triple buffer' may improve performance with some ASIO drivers. ASIO/Primary Sound: Revised 'Playback tracking' options to help with alignment of visual &amp; recorded events where soundcard problems exist. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Autosave / Autobackup - FL Studio can now be set to back up the current project at 5 to 15 minute intervals. Never lose project data again! \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢FL Studio Fruity Edition - Now gains access to Playlist Pattern Clips for unlimited scoring and automation flexibility. \n\nMinimum System Requirements \n\n* 2Ghz AMD or Intel Pentium 3 compatible CPU with full SSE1 support.
