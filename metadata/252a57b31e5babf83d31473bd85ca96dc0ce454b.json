Now back home in New Bordeaux, Lincoln is set on escaping a criminal past. But when his surrogate family, the black mob, is betrayed and wiped out by the Italian Mafia, Lincoln builds a new family on the ashes of the old and blazes a path of military-grade revenge through those responsible. Intense gun fights, visceral hand-to-hand combat, white knuckle driving and street smarts will all be needed. But with the right crew, tough decisions and some dirty hands, itâ€™s possible to make it to the top of the city's underworld. \r\nNEW BORDEAUX, A REIMAGINED 1968 NEW ORLEANS:\r\nA vast, diverse and seedy open world ruled by the mob and corrupt officials and richly detailed with the sights, sounds and emotionally-charged social atmosphere of the era.\r\nAN UNINTENDED AND LETHAL ANTI-HERO:\r\nBe Lincoln Clay, an orphan and Vietnam veteran hell bent on revenge against the Italian Mafia for the brutal slaughter of the black mob, the closest thing to family heâ€™s ever had.\r\nREVENGE YOUR WAY:\r\nChoose your own personal play-style, from brute force and blazing guns to stalk-and-kill tactics as you use Lincolnâ€™s military training and gathered intel to tear down the Italian Mafia.\r\nA NEW FAMILY ON THE ASHES OF THE OLD:\r\nBuild a new criminal empire in your own unique way by deciding which of your lieutenants you reward, and which you betrayâ€¦\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nMINIMUM: \r\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit \r\nProcessor: Intel I5-2500K, AMD FX-8120 \r\nMemory: 6 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 2GB of Video Memory &amp; NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, AMD Radeon HD7870 \r\nStorage: 50 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX Compliant Sound card \r\nAdditional Notes: Windows 8.1 users may need additional Windows Update files: Please Click here for information\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED: \r\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit \r\nProcessor: Intel I7-3770, AMD FX 8350 4.0 Ghz \r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 4GB of Video Memory &amp; NVIDIA Gefore GTX 780 or GeForce GTX 1060, AMD Radeon R9 290X \r\nStorage: 50 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX Compliant Sound card","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:252a57b31e5babf83d31473bd85ca96dc0ce454b","amp;dn":"Mafia.III.Cracked-P2P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"252a57b31e5babf83d31473bd85ca96dc0ce454b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,42,87,179,30,91,171,248,61,49,71,59,216,92,169,109,192,206,69,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
