His friend, Steve Dallas, is a moderately successful weather reporter who is living a superficial life. When Ben receives word that his father has died, Steve drives him home and they re-connect with Ben's successful and driven sister Terri and hippie step-mother Angela who is the same age as they are. The reading of the will drives Ben to come up with a new purpose in life, but those around him don't prove to be very supportive, and then they all re-examine their own life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cde8fb97226bd3a7a256142ca776a5450406a6d","amp;dn":"Are+You+Here+%282013%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cde8fb97226bd3a7a256142ca776a5450406a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,222,143,185,114,38,189,58,122,37,97,66,202,119,106,84,80,64,106,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
