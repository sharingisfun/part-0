His obsessive worrying affects not only his relationship with his wife, his friends and his boss, but also his own body - graphically demonstrated when he grows a large stress-related boil on his shoulder. But when the boil grows eyes and a mouth and starts talking, Bagley really begins to think he's lost his mind. But has he? \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090dd3493d9d05b81c9a0345a8413205f2bfd529","amp;dn":"How+to+Get+Ahead+in+Advertising+%281989%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090dd3493d9d05b81c9a0345a8413205f2bfd529","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,13,211,73,61,157,5,184,28,154,3,69,168,65,50,5,242,191,213,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
