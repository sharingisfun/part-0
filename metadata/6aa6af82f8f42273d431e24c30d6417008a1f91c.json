  "description": "Eunice Kathleen Waymon (February 21, 1933 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ April 21, 2003), better known by her stage name Nina Simone /Ã‹Ë†niÃ‹ï¿½nÃ‰â„¢ sÃ‰Â¨Ã‹Ë†moÃŠÅ n/, was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist widely associated with jazz music. Simone aspired to become a classical pianist while working in a broad range of styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&amp;B, gospel, and pop.\nBorn the sixth child of a preacher's family in North Carolina, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. Her musical path changed direction after she was denied a scholarship to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, despite a well-received audition. Simone was later told by someone working at Curtis that she was rejected because she was black. When she began playing in a small club in Philadelphia to fund her continuing musical education and become a classical pianist she was required to sing as well. She was approached for a recording by Bethlehem Records, and her rendering of &quot;I Loves You Porgy&quot; was a hit in the United States in 1958. Over the length of her career Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958Ã¢â‚¬â€when she made her debut with Little Girl BlueÃ¢â‚¬â€and 1974.\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Jazz\nQuality: 22 @ FLAC, 5 @320 kbps, 2 @ 192cbr, 3 @ 256vbr\nTracklist:\n\nBethlehem Period (1957-1959, 3 albums)\n\n(1957) Nina Simone - Little Girl Blue / Jazz As Played In An Exclusive Side Street Club [FLAC]\n(1959) Nina Simone - My Baby Just Cares For Me [FLAC]\n(1959) Nina Simone - Nina Simone And Her Friends [320 kbps]\n\nColpix Period (1959-1964, 10 albums)\n\n(1959) Nina Simone - Nina Simone at Town Hall [320 kbps]\n(1959) Nina Simone - The Amazing Nina Simone [FLAC]\n(1960) Nina Simone - Forbidden Fruit [FLAC]\n(1960) Nina Simone - Nina Simone at Newport [320 kbps]\n(1962) Nina Simone - Nina at the Village Gate [320 kbps]\n(1962) Nina Simone - Nina Sings Ellington [192cbr]\n(1963) Nina Simone - Nina Simone At Carnegie Hall [192cbr]\n(1964) Nina Simone - Folksy Nina [FLAC]\n(1966) Nina Simone - Nina Simone Sings The Blues [FLAC]\n(1966) Nina Simone - Nina Simone With Strings [FLAC]\n\nEuropean Years (from 1975, 5 albums)\n\n(1982) Nina Simone - Fodder on my Wings [FLAC]\n(1986) Nina Simone - My Baby Just Cares For Me [FLAC]\n(1987) Nina Simone - Let It Be Me (Live at Vine St.) [256vbr]\n(1988) Nina Simone - Nina's Back [FLAC]\n(1993) Nina Simone - A Single Woman [FLAC]\n\nPhilips Period (1964-1967, 7 albums)\n\n(1964) Nina Simone - Broadway Blues Ballads [FLAC]\n(1964) Nina Simone - In Concert [256vbr]\n(1965) Nina Simone - I Put A Spell On You [FLAC]\n(1965) Nina Simone - Pastel Blues [FLAC]\n(1966) Nina Simone - Let It All Out [FLAC]\n(1966) Nina Simone - Wild Is The Wind [FLAC]\n(1967) Nina Simone - High Priestess Of Soul [FLAC]\n\nRCA period (1967-1974, 8 albums)\n\n(1967) Nina Simone - Silk &amp; Soul [FLAC]\n(1968) Nina Simone -'Nuff Said!
