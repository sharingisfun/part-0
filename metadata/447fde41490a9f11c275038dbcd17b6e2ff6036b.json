It looks at childrenâ€™s individual development within the development of our species, at genes, at the hormone systems that flood our bodies, at the neuroscience of childrenâ€™s brains, and at patterns of behaviour. It looks, in other words, at the different influences on child development according to the scientific disciplines of evolutionary theory, genetics, epigenetics, endocrinology, neuroscience, epidemiology and psychology.\r\n\r\nFilled with entertaining anecdotes, Sara Meadows shares the story of what happens when weâ€™re growing up, revealing how science can add depth to our understanding. This book will be an informative and enriching read for all parents, educators and carers, and those interested in how children develop to be emotionally balanced, socially skilled, and enthusiastic seekers after knowledge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447fde41490a9f11c275038dbcd17b6e2ff6036b","amp;dn":"The+Science+Inside+the+Child+%282016%29+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447fde41490a9f11c275038dbcd17b6e2ff6036b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,127,222,65,73,10,159,17,194,117,3,141,188,209,123,110,47,246,3,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
