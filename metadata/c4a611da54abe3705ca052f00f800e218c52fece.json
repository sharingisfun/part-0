  "description": "Crusader Kings II: The Reapers Due (c) Paradox Interactive\r\n\r\n25-08-2016......Release Date  Protection.................Steam\r\nStrategy...........Game Type  Disk(s)....................1 DVD\r\n\r\nPROPER NOTES\r\n\r\nThe CODEX release promised you, that all DLC was included in their\r\nrelease. But their release is missing one DLC:\r\n\r\nSouth Indian Portraits\r\n\r\ndlcdlc065.dlc - missing\r\ndlcdlc065.zip - missing\r\n\r\nSkid Row to the rescue with a proper release with ALL DLC!\r\n\r\nRELEASE NOTES\r\n\r\nLittle remains of those settlements where the Black Death has passed\r\nthrough. Hasty burials make a mockery of the sacraments and set a feast\r\nfor the crows. Once prosperous provinces have been laid waste, and the\r\nlord of the land hides away - secluded in his hilltop fortress, hoping\r\nthe plague will pass him by. Wiser princes took precautions, and didn't\r\nwaste the revenues from more prosperous years\r\n\r\nBut, in time, all must pay The Reaper's Due\r\n\r\nThe Reaper's Due adds a host of new mechanics centered on the Black\r\nDeath and other world shaping epidemics. Lock your gates to keep the\r\nplague from infecting your court, even if it means cutting yourself\r\noff from your suffering citizens. Peace and good management will see\r\nyour provinces reward you with greater wealth and manpower, but\r\nconstant war and disease may depopulate your countryside\r\n\r\nThe Reaper's Due introduces many new systems and features to what is\r\nalready the richest medieval tapestry in gaming:\r\n\r\nThe Black Death: New additions to epidemic system include this super\r\ndestructive disease and a new map mode that track the expansion of\r\ndeadly illnesses\r\n\r\nCourt Physicians: This new position for learned courtiers opens up a\r\nseries of events tied to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases with\r\nmedieval tech\r\n\r\nHospitals: Slow down the spread of epidemics by investing in these\r\noutposts that care for the sick and infirm\r\n\r\nProsperity and Depopulation: Watch your provinces thrive under your\r\ncareful attention and degrade under the pressures of diseases run amok\r\n\r\nSeclusion: Take a page from the Masque of the Red Death and hide\r\nyourself away with your court as plagues ravage the countryside\r\n\r\nAnd even more: New physical traits, new events chains and a host of\r\nsmaller changes\r\n\r\nINSTALL NOTES\r\n\r\n1. Unpack the release\r\n2. Mount or burn image\r\n3. Install\r\n4. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder and into the main\r\ninstall folder and overwrite\r\n5.
