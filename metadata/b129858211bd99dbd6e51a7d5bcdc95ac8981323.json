Rooted in Gene RoddenberryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Star Trek universe, it was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller, at the request of Brandon Tartikoff, and produced by CBS Television Distribution. The main writers, in addition to Berman and Piller, included show runner Ira Steven Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Ronald D. Moore, Peter Allan Fields, Bradley Thompson, David Weddle, Hans Beimler, and RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Echevarria.\n\nA spin-off from Star Trek: The Next Generation, DS9 began while its parent series was still on the air, although there were few crossover episodes between the two shows. In addition, two Next Generation characters, Miles O'Brien and (from Season 4 onwards) Worf, became regular members of DS9.\n\nUnlike the other Star Trek programs, DS9 took place on a space station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with starships at the same time (the starship USS Defiant was introduced in season 3, but the station remained the primary setting for the show). This made continuing story arcs and the appearance of recurring characters much more feasible. The show is noted for its well-developed characters and its original, complex plots. Set between the years 2369ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2375, the series depended on darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and an emphasis (in later seasons) on many aspects of war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b129858211bd99dbd6e51a7d5bcdc95ac8981323","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Deep+Space+Nine+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6%2C+7+%2B+Extras+DS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b129858211bd99dbd6e51a7d5bcdc95ac8981323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,41,133,130,17,189,153,219,214,229,26,125,91,205,201,90,200,152,19,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
