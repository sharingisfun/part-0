Everyone.\n\nHundreds of thousands of professionals in (take a deep breath) architecture, construction, engineering, commercial interiors, light construction, landscape architecture, kitchen &amp; bath design, urban planning, game design, film &amp; stage, woodworking, and plenty of other fields use SketchUp Pro all the time, every day. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the all-purpose antidote to complicated, expensive CAD software.\n\nA smarter way to think about 3D modeling\n\nSketchUp Pro is like a pencil with superpowers. Start by drawing lines and shapes. Push and pull surfaces to turn them into 3D forms. Stretch, copy, rotate and paint to make anything you like. More advanced? Start modeling from CAD and terrain data, photographs or even hand sketches. Build models with custom behaviors and attributes. SketchUp Pro is as simple and as powerful as you want it to be.\n\nTurn your models into drawings with LayOut\n\nAt some point in every project, you need to produce a set of drawings that shows your model: plans, sections, elevations, perspectives. LayOut in SketchUp Pro lets you add model views to pages, choose drawing scales, adjust line weights and add dimensions, callouts and graphics. Changes to your model are reflected automatically in LayOut. When itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time, export PDFs, images and CAD files.\n\nGet good, fast.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a reason SketchUp is synonymous with friendly and forgiving 3D modeling software: we donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sacrifice usability for the sake of functionality. With handy contextual tips, a dedicated Instructor panel for beginners, and mountains of online resources, help is always on the way. And just in case, every SketchUp Pro license includes a year of free technical support.\n\nNo software is an island\n\nWe built SketchUp Pro to slide right into your existing workflow. Ready for some alphabet soup? With importers for DXF, DWG, 3DS, DAE, KMZ, TIF, JPG, PNG and a few more, you can bring in drawings, models and images to your heartÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s content. SketchUp Pro also exports all of those formats, plus PDF, OBJ, FBX, XSI, VRML, MP4, WEBM and AVI. OMG.\n\nSlides are boring. Present from SketchUp Pro.\n\nScenes let you save views of your model to pull up anytime. Styles provide endless visual effects to make your work look precise, sketchy or anything in between. Section Planes slice through models for creating sectional views. Go fullscreen, walk around, add labels and export flyover animations. Present from SketchUp Pro and get your point across every single time.\n\nModels and plugins aplenty\n\nNeed a particular chair for the room youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re designing? A lamp for your carriage house? A rhino for your zoo? YouÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find almost anything you need in SketchUpÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 3D Warehouse, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest repository of free 3D models. And as for plugins that provide extra features and tools, our all-new Extension Warehouse is your ticket to add-on nirvana.\n\nDon't just design. Analyze.\n\nSketchUp Pro can accurately predict where shadows will fall, given any time, date and location on earth. It can show you exactly what youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see from anywhere in your model. It will precisely calculate the area of any surface or material, or the volume of any enclosed 3D shape. It lets you add attributes to objects, and can spit out lists and reports with deliciously useful data.\n\nA world of context - literally\n\nIn about two minutes, you can choose a section of the world to bring into your SketchUp Pro modelÃ¢â‚¬â€up to a square kilometer at a time. For free, youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get aerial imagery, a 3D terrain model and lat-long data to produce accurate shadow studies. From there, you can import pre-modeled buildings for site context and use Google Maps Street View imagery to model anything else you need.\n\nA place for everything and everything in its place\n\nYour mother always told you that the key to 3D modeling success was tidiness and organization. Make your models easy to work on and easy to present. Use groups and components to divvy up your geometry into logical chunks. Layers come in handy for separating big pieces of your model, and the Outliner is a way to see everything at once.\n\nNew Features and FYI's:\n\n-An Extension Warehouse has been created and integrated with SketchUp. Users can now manage hundreds of extensions installed on their computer via the Extension Warehouse.\n-The word Ã¢â‚¬Å“SketchUpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ now refers to a product family of which there are two members: SketchUp Pro and SketchUp Make.\n-Toolbars for SketchUp on Windows operating systems have been improved. They are now customizable and more reliably stay put once they have been docked.\n-Scene-based animations can now be exported to high-quality video from SketchUp.\n-Toolbars and cursors have been updated and made consistent between SketchUp, LayOut, Style Builder and SketchUp Viewer.\n-We have a new SDK. See the Ã¢â‚¬Å“getting_started.htmlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“migration_guide.htmlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the SDK package for details.\n-Lots of little tweaks, bugs fixes and improvements were made to existing features.\n-SketchUp no longer will take a long time to open and close with an unstable Internet connection.\n-(Mac) SketchUp does not support OS X 10.6 and older versions of OS X. Users with these platforms will see an error on launch.\n-(Windows) XP SP3 is now required to run SketchUp on XP.\n\nExtension warehouse/Ruby plugins:\n-We are installing only the following extensions with the product : Advanced Camera Tools, Dynamic Components, Sandbox Tools, Photo Textures. The other SketchUp 8 extensions (Ruby Script Examples, Ocean Modeling, Utilities Tools, Shadow Strings Fix toolbar, Solar North toolbar) are available for download on the Extension Warehouse.\n-The plugins directory on the Mac has moved to ~/Library/Application Support/SketchUp 2013/SketchUp. We no longer install anything into the Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support/SketchUp directory.\n\nSketchUp Toolbars :\n-Toolbars now stay put and you can customize toolbars containing non-Ruby tool icons!\n-The SketchUp 8 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save toolbar positionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ menu choice has been removed as it is no longer needed - toolbar settings are saved when exiting SketchUp.\n-View &gt; Toolbars shows just one menu choice now. Customization of toolbars has been moved to one dialog.\n-SketchUp 2013 does not have the ability to create 2 column vertical toolbars (a limitation of the libraries we used as the basis of our new toolbars). If you want to create a setup similar to what is in SketchUp 8, you can either create a few new custom toolbars, docking them side by side to create 2 columns, or you can dock some of our smaller toolbars side by side.\n-To customize non-Ruby toolbars, bring up the View &gt; Toolbars dialog. You can move an icon from one toolbar to another by dragging it or pressing the Alt key. Holding down the Ctrl key allows you to copy an icon. Right clicking on a toolbar gives you some additional functionality.\n\nLayOut:\n-Changes were made to improve overall performance with LayOut.\n-Shapes can now be filled with image-based patterns in addition to solid colors. This is called Pattern Fill.\n-LayOut now has the ability to create multi-copy arrays, similar to the way SketchUp works.\n-Text leader lines can now be curved.\n-Users can now zoom in to a document up to 10,000%.\n-To better reflect standards, dimensions now have dashes to separate feet from inches.\n\nWhat's new in SketchUp 2014\n\nGet good fast - ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reason SketchUp is synonymous with friendly and forgiving 3D modeling software: we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sacrifice usability for the sake of functionality. Start by drawing lines and shapes. Push and pull surfaces to turn them into 3D forms. Stretch, copy, rotate and paint to make anything you like. If you want to be productive within a couple of hours, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to the right place\n\nFind a 3D model of anything - Why model everything from scratch? Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a chair for the room youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re designing or a rhino for your zoo, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find almost anything you need in SketchUpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 3D Warehouse, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest repository of free 3D models. And anyone can use 3D Warehouse to store and share models. Upload your best work and become a SketchUp legend.\n\nTurn models into drawings with LayOut - At some point in most 3D projects, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to turn your model into a set of drawings that gets the point across. LayOut in SketchUp Pro lets you add model views to pages, choose drawing scales, adjust line weights, and add dimensions, callouts, and graphics. Make a change to your SketchUp model, and find it reflected automatically in LayOut. And when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time, export PDFs, images and CAD files.\n\nOS : Windows XP sp3, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-pro&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-pro&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c38bc10de32f1e1b8d8b3ebe9e74dfff221a8260","amp;dn":"SketchUp+Pro+2014+14.0.4900+%28Cracked+files%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c38bc10de32f1e1b8d8b3ebe9e74dfff221a8260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,139,193,13,227,47,30,27,141,139,62,190,158,116,223,255,34,26,130,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
