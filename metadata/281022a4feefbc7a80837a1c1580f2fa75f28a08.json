  "description": "Release Date: 16th February 2015\nLanguage: English US\nType: Compression Archive\nLicense: Pre-Activated\n\nWinRAR is a powerful archive manager. It can backup your data and reduce the size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format.\n\nWhat's new in the latest version 5.21\n\n   1. &quot;Drag and drop context menu&quot; options in &quot;Settings/Integration/\n      Context menu items&quot; dialog allow to disable WinRAR archiving\n      and extraction commands in context menu displayed after dragging\n      and dropping files with right mouse button.\n\n   2. If winrar.ini file is present in the same folder as WinRAR installer,\n      winrar.ini will be copied to WinRAR program folder after completing\n      installation.\n\n   3. While previous versions could produce RAR5 volumes of slightly\n      smaller than requested size sometimes, such situation is less\n      likely now. In most cases volume size equals to specified by user.\n\n   4. Now by default WinRAR skips symbolic links with absolute paths\n      in link target when extracting. You can enable creating such links\n      with &quot;Allow absolute paths in symbolic links&quot; option on &quot;Advanced&quot;\n      page of extraction dialog or with -ola command line switch.\n\n      Such links pointing to folders outside of extraction destination\n      folder can present a security risk. Enable their extraction only\n      if you are sure that archive contents is safe, such as your own backup.\n      \n   5. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) WinRAR 5.20 issued unnecessary user account control (UAC) prompt,\n         when running an executable from archive stored in UAC protected\n         folder. Since nothing is extracted to folder containing an archive\n         in such case, UAC prompt is not needed;\n\n      b) WinRAR could overwrite files with read-only attribute only\n         when unpacking RAR and ZIP archive formats. Now it is also\n         implemented for other archive formats supported by WinRAR;\n\n      c) &quot;Elapsed time&quot; and &quot;Time left&quot; were displayed incorrectly\n         when applying &quot;Convert&quot; command to multiple archives\n         and enabling &quot;Add recovery record&quot; option.\n\nIt is Pre-Activated, so just install and use it. No need to use any crack, patch or license. Its already activated with lifetime licensed for unlimited Company.\nNo virus, No malware. 100% Clean Install",
