The hardware consists of an open-source hardware board designed around an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller, or a 32-bit Atmel ARM. Current models feature an USB interface, 6 analog input pins, as well as 14 digital I/O pins which allow to attach various extension boards.\n\nIntroduced in 2005, it was designed to give students an inexpensive and easy way to program interactive objects. It comes with a simple integrated development environment (IDE) that runs on regular personal computers and allows to write programs for Arduino using C or C++.\n\nThe current prices of Arduino boards run around $30 and those of related &quot;clones&quot; as low as $9. Arduino boards can be purchased pre-assembled or as do-it-yourself kits. Hardware design information is available for those who would like to assemble an Arduino by hand. It was estimated in mid-2011 that over 300,000 official Arduinos had been commercially produced, and in 2013 that 700,000 official boards were in users' hands.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino\n\nBooks list:\n\n-Make_a_Mind_Controlled_Arduino_Robot.pdf\n-iOS Sensor Apps with Arduino.pdf\n-Getting_Started_with_Arduino_Second_Edition.pdf\n-Building Autonomous Line Followers using Arduino and PID.pdf\n-Beginning Arduino Programming,-2010kaiser.pdf\n-Arduino Wearables-2010kaiser.pdf\n-Arduino Internals.pdf\n-Arduino Internals 2.pdf\n-Making Things See.pdf\n-Robert Faludi - Building Wireless Sensor Networks with ZigBee, XBee, Arduino, and Processing - 2010.pdf\n-Raspberry Pi Home Automation with Arduino.pdf\n-Programming Your Home - Automate with Arduino, Android, and Your Computer 2012 (Pdf ,Epub) -Mantesh\n-Professional Android Open Accessory Programming With Arduino V413HAV\n-MintDuino - Building an Arduino Compatible Breadboard Microcontroller V413HAV.pdf\n-Make an Arduino Controlled Robot 2012\n-Learn Electronics With Arduino V413HAV\n-Ebook.OREILLY-MAKE ARDUINO BOTS AND GADGETS SIX EMBEDDED PROJECTS WITH OPEN SOURCE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE pdf\n-Atmospheric Monitoring With Arduino V413HAV\n-Arduino Workshop No Starch 2013\n-Arduino_Starter_Kit_Manual-Mar2010.pdf\n-Arduino Robotics\n-Arduino in Action 2013\n-Arduino Cookbook.pdf\n-Arduino and Kinect Projects.pdf\n-Arduino projects to save the world.pdf\n-Beginning Android ADK with Arduino.pdf\n-Environmental Monitoring with Arduino.pdf\n-Practical Arduino Cool Projects for Open Source Hardware.pdf\n-Practical Arduino Engineering.epub\n-Arduino Adventures V413HAV.pdf\n-Arduino + Android Projects for the Evil Genius V413HAV\n-Apress Arduino Adventures 2013 Retail eBook-BitBook\n-Apress - Arduino and Kinect Projects 2012 RETAiL eBOOk-rebOOk\n-Arduino_getting_started_kit Folder\n-2009-11-17-arduino-basics.pdf\n-Arduino - A Quick Start Guide.pdf\n-Arduino Lab 1.pdf\n-Arduino_Booklet.pdf\n-Arduino_Massimo.pdf\n-arduino_notebook_v1-1.pdf\n-ARDUINO_NOTEBOOKv6.pdf\n-arduino_projects.pdf\n-Arduino_workshop_sensors.pdf\n-arduino-mini-user-guide.pdf\n-ArduinoNanoManual23.pdf\n-arduino-talk.pdf\n-ARDX-experimenters-guide-WEB.pdf\n-Ham Radio for Arduino and PICAXE.pdf\n-self_sufficient_arduino1_2.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:106cfd29c5841b971ac480e438d10f0528aac75f","amp;dn":"ARDUINO+-+49+books+%5BENG%5D+%5B.pdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"106cfd29c5841b971ac480e438d10f0528aac75f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,108,253,41,197,132,27,151,26,196,128,228,56,209,15,5,40,170,199,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
