  "description": "All episodes are bluray/1080p rips converted to 720X406 MKV 5.1 surround sound h264 with English subtitles &amp; extras.\n\n\n\n\nJustified is an American television drama series developed by Graham Yost. It is based on Elmore Leonard's novels Pronto (1993) and Riding the Rap (1995), and his short story &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;. Its main character is Raylan Givens, a deputy U.S. Marshal. Timothy Olyphant portrays Givens, a tough federal lawman, enforcing his own brand of justice in his Kentucky hometown. The series is set in the city of Lexington, Kentucky, and the hill country of eastern Kentucky, specifically in and around Harlan.\n\nJustified premiered on March 16, 2010, on the FX network. The show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on February 9, 2011. A third season of 13 episodes was announced on March 29, 2011, and premiered January 17, 2012. A fourth season of 13 episodes was announced on March 6, 2012 and premiered January 8, 2013. The show was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on January 7, 2014. On January 14, 2014, FX Network CEO John Landgraf confirmed that the show was renewed for a sixth season, which will be its last. The decision was made based on a decision from Graham Yost and star Timothy Olyphant.\n\nJustified has received widespread critical acclaim throughout all five seasons, particularly for its acting, directing, art direction, and writing, as well as for Olyphant's lead performance. Justified has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards as of 2012, with two wins, for Margo Martindale's performance as Mags Bennett and Jeremy Davies' performance as Dickie Bennett.\n\n\n\n\nPlease seed at a decent speed.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\nTSV.",
