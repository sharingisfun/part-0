  "description": "Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why is this town called MotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rest?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all Reacher wants to know. But no one will tell him. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tiny place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then turned lethal.\n\nReacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something about Chang ... so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be? But before long heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plunged into a desperate race through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the wayÃ¢â‚¬â€right back to where he started, in MotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rest, where he must confront the worst nightmare he could imagine.\n\nWalking away would have been easier. But as always, ReacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule is: If you want me to stop, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have to make me.\n\n\n\nRead by Dick Hill\nFormat: MP3",
