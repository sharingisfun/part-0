  "description": "The 10th edition of HallidayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fundamentals of Physics builds upon previous editions by offering several new features to address the common course issues in calc-based Physics. Examples include: chapter sections organized and numbered to match the Concept Modules; added Learning Objectives; illustrations changed to reflect multimedia versions available in WileyPLUS; and new free body diagrams, GO tutorials and video illustrations in WileyPLUS.\n\nThe new edition offers the most accurate, extensive and varied set of assessment questions of any course management program in addition to all questions including some form of question assistance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including answer-specific feedback Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to facilitate success.  The text also offers multimedia presentations (videos and animations) of much of the material that provide an alternative pathway through the material; ideal for those who struggle with reading scientific exposition. Furthermore, the book includes math review content in both a self-study module for more in-depth review. Also, just-in-time math videos are available for a quick refresher on a specific topic.\n\nThe Halliday content is widely accepted as clear, correct, and complete.  The end-of-chapters problems are without peer.  The new design, which was introduced in 9e continues with 10e, making this new edition of Halliday the most accessible and reader-friendly book on the market.\n\nWileyPLUS sold separately from text.\n\nFundamentals of Physics Extended (10th edition)\nBook Language: English\nPages: 1448\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 30.8 MB\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/p9qWLZ2.jpg[/IMG]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/p9qWLZ2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/p9qWLZ2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
