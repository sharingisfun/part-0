  "description": "Defcon\n(Modified ISO of original Defcon 1.43 Disc, with crack. NOTE: Online play doesn't work with cracked version, but Single and LAN play works)\n\nDeveloper:\nIntroversion\n\nOfficial Website:\nhttp://www.introversion.co.uk/defcon/\n\nAbout:\nIntroversion Software presents its third title, DEFCON, a stunning online multiplayer simulation of global thermonuclear war.\n\nYou play the role of a military Commander hidden deep within an Underground bunker. Your mission - to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst disabling their ability to attack your own. Start by launching your battleships, subs and bombers in order to decimate your opponent's defences. Scramble together your alliances but remember only one can stand victorious.\n\nPrepare your pre-emptive strike before one of your supposed allies gets the same idea. Choose the perfect moment for betrayal, obliterating your opponents with an apocalyptic thermonuclear barrage, but get it wrong and their devastating counter attack will bring you to your knees!\n\nIt's Global Thermonuclear War, and nobody wins. But maybe - just maybe - you can lose the least.\n\n\n\n\nHashes:\nCRC32: C98EAF8F\nMD5: 8AA8095E89E24DCEFAA78B228F2A1B8E\nSHA-1: B12A3F9D9D704A9AA084378424E3CE6AB37A6974 \n\n\nFor a collection of Uplink, Darwinia, and Defcon all on one disc, see here:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5510028/Introversion_Collection_%28Uplink_Darwinia_Defcon%29",
