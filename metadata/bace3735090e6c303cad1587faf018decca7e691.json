McGraw-Hill's SAT 2014 views better in Calibre, due to formatting on the workseets. They also have some practice tests on the website, with email registration required.\n\nThese are the only formats I could get my hands on, just use a reader as specified above. You can print out the worksheets with ADE, Calibre and Adobe Reader. Tested on the above readers with no problems.\nDon't hesitate to PM me if you have any questions or problem with the download, as comments on the torrent are easy to miss.
