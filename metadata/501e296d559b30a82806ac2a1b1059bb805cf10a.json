  "description": "The Cranberries are an Irish rock band formed in Limerick in 1990 under the name The Cranberry Saw Us, later changed by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie, indie pop, rock, post-punk and pop rock elements.\n\nThe Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, which became a high commercial success and sold over five million copies in the United States. The group was one of the most successful rock acts of the '90s and sold over 14.5 million albums in the United States alone. The band has achieved four top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?; No Need To Argue; To the Faithful Departed and Bury the Hatchet)[1] and eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (&quot;Linger&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Zombie&quot;, &quot;Ode to My Family&quot;, &quot;Ridiculous Thoughts, &quot;Salvation&quot;, &quot;Free To Decide&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot;).[1]\n\n\nLATER 4 U",
