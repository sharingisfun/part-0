  "description": "SketchUp Pro 2016 Mac OS X {B4tman}\r\n \nhttp://s3.postimg.org/wd0vxm2an/image.png \nhttp://s3.postimg.org/5t8avh1r7/image.jpg\r\n\r\nDescription:-\r\n\r\nSketchUp Pro is an easy-to-learn 3D modeling program that enables you to explore the world in 3D. With just a few simple tools, you can create 3D models of houses, sheds, decks, home additions, woodworking projects â€“ even space ships. And once youâ€™ve built your models, you can place them in Google Earth, post them to the 3D Warehouse, or print hard copies.\r\n\r\nFeatures:-\r\n\r\nFind a 3D model of anything:-\r\n\r\nWhy model everything from scratch? Whether it's a chair for the room you're designing or a rhino for your zoo, you'll find almost anything you need in SketchUp's 3D Warehouse, the world's biggest repository of free 3D models. And anyone can use 3D Warehouse to store and share models. Upload your best work and become a SketchUp legend.\r\n\r\nTurn models into documents:-\r\n\r\nAt some point in most 3D projects, you'll need to turn your model into a set of drawings that gets the point across. LayOut in SketchUp Pro lets you add model views to pages, choose drawing scales, adjust line weights, and add dimensions, callouts, and graphics. Make a change to your SketchUp model, and find it reflected automatically in LayOut. And when it's time, export PDFs, images and CAD files.\r\n\r\nMake SketchUp yours:-\r\n\r\nSketchUp is meant to be customized. Thanks to our Ruby API and an amazing community of developers, today you can explore an entire universe of extensions. These are add-on tools built to solve the kind of 3D modeling problems that might otherwise leave you scratching your head. Need to draw 3D moldings? There's an extension for that. Wouldn't it be cool to bend your models to fit a curve? That's possible, too. Photorealistic rendering? Definitely. If you can imagine a SketchUp extension, chances are it already exists.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:-\r\n\r\nâ€¢ OS X 10.8 or later",
