  "description": "this is a cracked Red Gate .NET Reflector 8.2.0.7 I tested it and it works I cant wait to start using it. \n\nso enjoy guys\n\nDebugging your application\nFollow bugs through your application to see where your problems lie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether it's in your own code, third-party libraries, or components used by your application.\nÃ¢Å“â€Understand how applications work\nInherited applications with little or no documentation or comments are hard to develop. Use .NET Reflector to understand how the code runs and avoid bugs.\nÃ¢Å“â€SharePoint and other third-party platforms\nLike many third-party platforms, SharePoint APIs and libraries aren't always well-documented. With .NET Reflector you can look inside their assemblies and see how they work and which APIs you can call.\nCode smarter with .NET Reflector\n.NET Reflector saves time and simplifies development by letting you see and debug into the source of all the .NET code you work with.\n\nDevelopment is increasingly dependent on third-party technologies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ using available frameworks and libraries is a great way to get stuff done fast without re-inventing the wheel.\n\nBut the problem with using code you didn't write is that you're dependent on the documentation, and it's hard to debug. Documentation is often missing or incomplete, and debugging has to stop where your own code stops. This gets even worse with a legacy code base. Use .NET Reflector to look into the black box of missing or undocumented source code and start coding with confidence.",
