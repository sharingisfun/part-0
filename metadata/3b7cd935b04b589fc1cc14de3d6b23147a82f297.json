This user felt the need to label each and every .mp3 file with a Copyright of [NoFS]. This notion of labeling individual files as ones own is counter-productive to the freedom of information. Although these files were intended to possess Copyright protection, they were in no way intended to be labeled by [NoFS]. \n\nAlso, each and every file was initially titled incorrectly causing programs such as iTunes and WinAmp to order the songs incorrectly. I have taken the liberty of stripping any and all Copyright labeling on these files, as well as comments. I have renamed the files to organize just right in iTunes and WinAmp. \n\ninformation should be free. kopimi.\nnow go tell [NoFS] what it means to be a pirate.  \n\n--i plead the 5th.--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b7cd935b04b589fc1cc14de3d6b23147a82f297","amp;dn":"Kid+Cudi+-+Man+on+the+Moon+II+-+The+Legend+of+Mr.+Rager+%5B2010-32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b7cd935b04b589fc1cc14de3d6b23147a82f297","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,124,217,53,176,75,88,159,193,204,20,222,61,107,35,20,122,130,242,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
