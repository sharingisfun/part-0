Now a magazine writer, Amy lives by that credo - enjoying what she feels is an uninhibited life free from stifling, boring romantic commitment - but in actuality, she's kind of in a rut. When she finds herself starting to fall for the subject of the new article she's writing, a charming and successful sports doctor named Aaron Conners, Amy starts to wonder if other grown-ups, including this guy who really seems to like her, might be on to something.\n\nDirector: Judd Apatow\nWriter: Amy Schumer\nStars: Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Brie Larson\nGenres: Comedy\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\n\n\nRELEASE: Trainwreck.2015.REPACK.READNFO.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO                                             \n\n SOURCE: Shws (1080p) - Thanks!                                               \n\n ViDEO: 1500 kbps XviD               \n\n RESOLUTiON: 720x272                           \n\n RUNTiME: 2h4m33sec      \n\n SUBTiTLES: A few times, 1-line of chinese subs on the top. (2-3 times) \n                            \n AUDiO: 192 CBR AC-3        \n\n LANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \n\n GREETS: Srkfan &amp; AQOS \n \n NOTES: You are wondering why is missing the HC tag, well, since the source had 65% of their subs on the back bars, there was no point of doing a release with it, meaning, we cut'd out a few pixels and we got a subs free release without &quot;getting&quot; a cropped and  weird release. Yap, their heads are still intact and correctly. lol\nEnjoy.\n\n EXTRAS NOTES: We watched several parts searching for censure, but seems like it is complete, no parts we're cut, at least there lots of sex scenes and their ass are there.\n(including John Cena lol)\nAlso, the runtime matches the one stated on the IMDb.                              \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4v&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4v&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4A&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4W&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4W&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/O4f&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/OB8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/OB8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/OBa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/OBa&lt;/a&gt;",
