The 3D match engine has seen extensive improvements, including enhanced AI, improved lighting and player animation, individual player character and kit models, more realistic player reaction to on-field incidents and a range of optimisations which combine to make this the best looking and fastest FM Match Engine yet. On the pitch, redesigned tactics management makes the player roles and team strategies even more prominent. Improvements to rival managersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ AI allow them to adapt their tactics more readily over time.\n\nFM 2014 features a revamped transfer module where opposing clubs and managers adopt a more realistic approach when making or responding to transfer offers. In addition, a number of new Ã¢â‚¬Ëœreal worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ transfer clauses have been added, such as the facility to loan a player back to the club heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of cash and loan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance fee. On top of this, the old Ã¢â‚¬Ëœturn-basedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ system of transfer negotiations can now be done two ways, the tried and tested system and a new Ã¢â‚¬ËœliveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ system, similar to that used in FMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contract negotiations.\n\nThe 3D match engine has seen extensive improvements, including enhanced AI, improved lighting and player animation, individual player character and kit models, more realistic player reaction to on-field incidents and a range of optimisations which combine to make this the best looking and fastest FM Match Engine yet.
