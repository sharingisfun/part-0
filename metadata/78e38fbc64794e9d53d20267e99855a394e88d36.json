Empire Earth spans 500,000 years of world history, which is divided into 14 epochs, beginning with the prehistoric age, and ending with the nano age.\nAn expansion pack was developed by Mad Doc Software called Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest, which was released on September 17, 2002. It added new features such as a special power for each civilization, and a new 15th epoch, entitled the Space Age, which focuses on the colonization of space planets. \n\nFor more Info  &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Earth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Earth&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCd Keys:\nLES9-RUC2-TYM8-CEJ3-2727 \nTUS5-LEF6-TEM9-MER6-7453 \nNYR2-BAD2-GYM5-CEZ6-7337 \nRAN6-MUG2-SYJ2-GYL7-3385\n\nfor online play download Save EE Lobby Here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.save-ee.com/EE-LOBBY-UPDATE.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.save-ee.com/EE-LOBBY-UPDATE.exe&lt;/a&gt;\nAnd please Donate to Save EE to Keep the Servers up and running\nTO FIND ME ONLINE IM BLAZEZ3212\n\nps.
