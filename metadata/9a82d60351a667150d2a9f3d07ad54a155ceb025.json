(Oof. Here we go again.)  I'm  a  mercenary  with  an\r\naccelerated healing factor. I've been described as unstable, which is just\r\nplain coo-coo. (Wait, do sane people say coo-coo?) I'm  gonna  battle  for\r\nthe safety of humans and mutants. (And even mumans.) Be prepared for  just\r\nabout anything. (Holla!)\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n=========\r\n\r\n* I made sure to capture all my good sides, so I made my game a\r\n third-person action-shooter. (Yep, you get to look at my heinie.)\r\n* Keep a look out cuz some of my X-Men pals (Whoa, what pals?!) are making\r\n an appearance. (Hope you don't mind picking hair out of your tacos.)\r\n* I'm really good at killing, so I made it a blast stringing together\r\n combos, and totally eviscerating my enemies. (Ev-is-cer-a-ting!)\r\n* I brought my skills and a buttload of my favorite things. Katanas\r\n (check), guns (bang!) explosives (boom), duct tape (quack) and of\r\n course, yours truly - ME! (Checkmate!)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation Information:\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n* Burn or mount\r\n* Install\r\n* Play the game\r\n\r\nNOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\r\n\r\n                                                           /TEAM FAiRLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                  +-+  QUALITY, TRADITION  AND PRIDE +-+\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nMinimum:\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP\r\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo E8200 @ 2.66 GHz or AMD Phenom X3 8750\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: GeForce 8800 GT series with 512 MB RAM or ATI Radeon HD4850 with 512MB RAM\r\nDirectXï¿½: 9.0c\r\nHard Drive: 7 GB HD space\r\nSound: DirectXï¿½ 9.0c or later\r\nOther Requirements: Broadband Internet connection\r\nAdditional: Internet connection is for Steam only.
