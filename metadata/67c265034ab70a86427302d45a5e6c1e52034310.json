Use the link to get the program to repatch dnas image file here --\n\n \nThe file name u are looking to patch is named 'DNAS280.IMG' and will be under the NFSUNDER folder name inside the Underground2 Iso, You'll have to extract the file from the iso to find with disc id insertor and in order to key in the code I provided and then patch it, then reinsert it the dnas280.img back where it was before originally in the ISO, theeen reburn the ISO like you did before for playing ps2 games, and hopefully the online feature should be up to par now and work.\n\nOkay I did test it patched and reinserted it but I had to rebuilt the iso using Isobuster pro, with cd_gen 2.0 (for cd_gen 1.5 or 2.0 you need Forceaspi or winaspi drivers installed for the program to function right, you also need to install cdgen through the 'command' not 'cmd' prompt in the start run box in command prompt look for install.exe then run from there)and then used IMLtoDVD, finally burned it with dvd decrypter to make it work. You can't use poweriso or something and resave the iso it simply won't work that way. Heres a link that explains and has the programs you need in order to rebuilt ps2 games..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/275350&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/275350&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHere's the Disc Id utility to use to find the dnas code its the disc id\nthe program has info explaining how to use it, you need to use this with your original ps2 game that has online feature. Use this in conjuction with the disc id insertor. Then rebuilt the iso explained in the above http link.\n\n\n(Or you can try Ps2 Dnas Code Patcher app or Windip to patch it no need to rebuilt).\n\n\n(You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.)\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Try Verbatim DVD+R (Booktype to DVD-ROM), or Tayio Yuden, burn at 8x if its a 16x max. You really can't use Maxell DVD+R for example or some other brand as it more than likely will not work.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.\n\n\nCompressed with Winrar.\n\n\nDidn't see a proper upload for this game, so I decided to put it out there.\n\nIncludes readme &amp; game pics.\n\nBurn with Dvd Decrypter or ImgBurn, burn at half speed of max write rate of disc...\nIf 16x burn at 8x etc.\n\nhere's link for dvd decrypter..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mrbass.org/dvdrip/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mrbass.org/dvdrip/&lt;/a&gt;\n(At website look down to where you see the link for DVDDecrypter 3.5.4.0 download)\n(The link will be named 'SetupDVDDecrypter_3.5.4.0.exe')\n\nBest to burn with Verbatim, or Tayio Yuden.\n(If DVD+R then book type to DVD-ROM)\n\nIf you have any issues or problems post a comment.\n\n\nDon't forget to Seed!\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\nYou guys and anyone else downloading this need to seed don't just leech, I can't seed all the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67c265034ab70a86427302d45a5e6c1e52034310","amp;dn":"Need+for+Speed+Underground+2+%5BNtsc%5D+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67c265034ab70a86427302d45a5e6c1e52034310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,194,101,3,74,183,10,134,66,115,2,212,90,94,108,30,82,3,67,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
