  "description": "These are the original daily ebook packs released by the group known as The NERDs\r\n\r\nSEE THE INCLUDED INDEX TEXT FILE FOR CONTENTS OF THIS TORRENT\r\nSEE THE INCLUDED LINKS ZIP FILE FOR PREVIOUS TORRENTS\r\n\r\nA list of the complete collection, 2003 to date, is also included for reference.You can view these files quickly by setting them to Priority High.\r\n\r\nIf you arenâ€™t familiar with NERDs ebooks, sample a single day from a smaller, more recent torrent by setting other files in the torrent to Priority â€œdo not downloadâ€.\r\n\r\nThe complete collection contains over 300,000 ebooks, is over 415GB RARâ€™d, would be double that otherwise and will not be posted in any other format.  Everything about these torrents is done for a reason, not without thought.  The RAR file naming convention is purposely to evade DMCA crawlers.\r\n\r\nThese torrents are an expression of appreciation to the NERDs for making all these wonderful ebooks available, providing missing and broken files as needed and giving me their blessing to redistribute them here.\r\n\r\nEither youâ€™re familiar with NERDs ebooks and delighted at the opportunity to back fill your collection, or youâ€™re lucky enough to discover them now while theyâ€™re still available, or you can whine and complain and miss the boat. Your choice.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to everyone for all the nice comments and feedback on earlier torrents and a special thanks to everyone that has contributed their bandwidth and resources to help seed.\r\n\r\nFeel free to express your appreciation to the NERDs for the time and effort it takes to source, convert and package all these ebooks. I'm just a messenger.\r\n\r\nEnjoy",
