If you have always wanted to use Vista, but were holding\n out for Windows 7 - its worth it! This slimmed edition boots up fast,\n shuts down fast, opens applications fast, even VMware v5.5 runs fast\n on it once its started up. File copying seems no slower than XP. All\n in all this new Windows really blows away XP because of all the new\n features. You have to remember XP is from 2001 when no one even had\n such a thing as &quot;Wireless&quot; or a SATA drive. Now all this new hardware\n runs on Windows XP but the OS was never designed to run it really.\n You might wonder why not just use Vista - don't even go there. Lets\n just pretend Vista never existed. In fact Microsoft should have not\n ever released it but I guess they had to in order to improve on it\n and eventually get it right - with Windows 7.\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n ISO File MD5 Hash:\n\n 1F81758BE8A07148332902C16B38F3EB\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n Don't forget To Join The Forum @ SnipeR's Redemption Network:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.retestrak.nl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.retestrak.nl/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n Enjoy this fine release from eXPerience \n\n Build Date: 3rd August 2009\n\n Release Date : Summer 2009\n\n ________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501c0a15de1608bbc8df6111f5b2e5e649f45166","amp;dn":"Windows+Tiny7+Unattended+Activated+CD+%28x86%29+-+eXPerience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501c0a15de1608bbc8df6111f5b2e5e649f45166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,28,10,21,222,22,8,187,200,223,97,17,245,178,229,230,73,244,81,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
