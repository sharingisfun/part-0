  "description": "\nMathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics, Eric Lengyel\nISBN-13: 978-1435458864  3rd edition, 2011.\n\n\nThis updated third edition illustrates the mathematical concepts that a game developer needs to develop 3D computer graphics and game engines at the professional level. It starts at a fairly basic level in areas such as vector geometry and linear algebra, and then progresses to more advanced topics in 3D programming such as illumination and visibility determination. Particular attention is given to derivations of key results, ensuring that the reader is not forced to endure gaps in the theory. The book assumes a working knowledge of trigonometry and calculus, but also includes sections that review the important tools used from these disciplines, such as trigonometric identities, differential equations, and Taylor series.\n\nThe third edition expands upon topics that include projections, shadows, physics, cloth simulation, and numerical methods. All of the illustrations have been updated, and the shader code has been updated to the latest high-level shading language specifications.\n\n\nContents:\n========\n1.  The Rendering Pipeline\n2.  Vectors\n3.  Matrices\n4.  Transforms\n5.  3D Engine Geometry\n6.  Ray Tracing\n7.  Illumination\n8.  Visibility Determination\n9.  Collision Detection\n10. Polygonal Techniques\n11. Shadows\n12. Linear Physics\n13. Rotational Physics\n14. Fluid Simulation\n15. Numerical Methods\n16. Curves and Surfaces\n\nAppendix A: Complex Numbers\nAppendix B: Trigonometry Reference\nAppendix C: Coordinate Systems\nAppendix D: Taylor Series\nAppendix E: Answers to Exercises\n\nAbout the Author:\n================\nEric Lengyel is a veteran of the computer games industry with over 16 years of experience writing game engines. He has a PhD in Computer Science from the University of California at Davis and an MS in Mathematics from Virginia Tech. Eric is the founder of Terathon Software, where he currently leads ongoing development of the C4 Engine.  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=1435458877&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.com/books?isbn=1435458877&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-",
