It also has the correct album art in each folder, in case it doesn't automatically apply it in your music player (I pulled these straight from google images so some of them are low resolution but for itunes or an ipod they're sufficient in my book).\n\nI spent a long time searching down high quality files for this torrent, and it took me a while to do. However, I finally did it. I saw another torrent that was similar to this, but probably didn't have high quality files like mine, not to mention the guy isn't seeding. I'll be seeding this nonstop for at least a month on my desktop &amp; laptop simultaneously (laptop from various different locations) so hopefully this will get out there asap.\n\nAs a side note: Deadmau5 ftw.\n\nGet Scraped\n320 kbp/s (CBR)\n\n1.
