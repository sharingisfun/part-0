Set via the Terrain settings and with the &quot;collectDetailPatches&quot; property. Can reduce hiccups when navigating a Terrain.\nTerrain: Improved tree culling performance.\nWindows Phone / Store: Slightly improved performance in master builds.\n\n\nFIXES\n2D: Fixed sprite importing regression which caused sprite references to be lost on texture rename.\nAndroid: Fixed application hanging and crashing when trying to close the IME with the back button.\nAndroid: Fixed game starting not full screen if the orientation is not set to Auto Rotation.\nAndroid: Fixed mouse input for interacting with standard GUI.\nAsset Import: Fixed crash when plugin DLL calls AssetDatabase.Refresh in type initializer.\nEditor &amp; Webplayer: Fixed crash when loading some meshes imported with Unity 3.5.\nEditor: Fixed &quot;ArgumentException: Invalid path&quot; error that might occur with some custom windows.\nEditor: Fixed an issue whereby text went out of the TextArea in custom editor when return was pressed or multi line text was pasted.\nEditor: Fixed Asset Store window showing up blank in DirectX 11 mode on some Intel graphics cards.\nEditor: Fixed Hierarchy NullReferenceException happening when dragging an item over another item that is not a parent.\nEditor: Fixed inspector rendering when having more than one missing script on a GameObject.\nEditor: Fixed launch of Visual Studio for script editing, added additional logging to the editor log to troubleshoot future problems.\nEditor: Fixed that a hidden Hierarchy window did not refresh when changing scenes.\nEditor: Fixed that the icon for Alphabetical Sorting in the Hierarchy toolbar did not show when selected.\nEditor: Fixed that when searching in the Hierarchy clicking on a search result item and then on &quot;x&quot; button did not reveal it.\nEditor: Multiple events in the animation window can be dragged.\nEditor: SpritePacker will not crash packing sprites generated from textures with certain OnPostprocessTexture scripts.\nEditor/iOS: Large memory samples in profiler now work. Fix for the error &quot;Buffer is not large enough for the message.&quot;\nGraphics: Fixed Shader Material Keyword changes not applying to Materials on objects in the scene.\nGraphics: Fixed skinned meshes sometimes not rendering in player builds when Read/Write Enabled import option is disabled.\nGraphics: Fixed stencil modes only affecting front facing geometry when shader has Cull Off.\nGraphics: Fixed textures in material property blocks (e.g. sprites) sometimes messing up other textures in the material on OpenGL.\nGraphics: Fixed &quot;allocation 0x00000000 already registered&quot; error messages.\nGraphics: Work around crash when trying to read invalid shader properties.\nIMGUI: OnMouseExit not called when mouse is moved from a collider to IMGUI element that is occluding it.\niOS: Fixed crash occurring when using webcam texture whilst privacy settings deny access to the camera.\niOS: Fixed handling of resolution preset in Player Settings.\niOS: Fixed startup orientation handling on iOS 8.\niOS: Support files with multiple fonts when building font metadata.\niOS: Update and render additional frame after app suspension.
