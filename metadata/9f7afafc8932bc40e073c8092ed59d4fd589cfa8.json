  "description": "HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rarlabs RAR command-line tools (for terminal apps) as an OSX Installer with a valid license. It will install the latest version of rar and unrar to /usr/bin. It will also install the license file. Requirements are Intel CPU and 10.6.6 or higher.\n\nDescription:-\n\n WinRAR is a powerful archive manager (Windows, Linux, Mac). This is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format. The archiver puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. It automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well. RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can.\n\nRAR Ã¢â‚¬â€œ WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new in the latest version Version 5.20:-\n\n: RAR can read the default set of switches from .rarrc file stored in the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home directory. Previously it was possible to define only the same set of switches for all RAR command with Ã¢â‚¬Å“switches=Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ string. Now .rarrc also allows to specify separate switch sets for individual RAR commands using the following syntax: switches_\n: For example: switches_a=-m5 -s / switches_x=-o+\n: File overwrite prompt displays the size and modification time for existing and new files.\n: When archiving from stdin with -si switch, RAR sets the current system time to modification time of archived file. Previous version did not set this time at all.\n: It is possible to use -si and -vswitches together. Previous versions did not allow to create volumes when archiving from stdin",
