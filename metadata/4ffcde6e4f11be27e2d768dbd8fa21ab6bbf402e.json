The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Metallica was formed in 1981 when James Hetfield responded to an advertisement that drummer Lars Ulrich had posted in a local newspaper. The current line-up features founders Hetfield (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Ulrich (drums), longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo, who joined the band in 2003. Previous members of the band are lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who went on to found Megadeth, bassists Ron McGovney (demos only), Cliff Burton (the first three records, died in 1986), and Jason Newsted (from 1987 to 2001). The band also had a long collaboration with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of its albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ffcde6e4f11be27e2d768dbd8fa21ab6bbf402e","amp;dn":"Metallica-Metallica+%28The+Black+Album%29+1991+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ffcde6e4f11be27e2d768dbd8fa21ab6bbf402e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,252,222,110,79,17,190,39,226,215,104,219,216,250,33,171,107,191,64,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
