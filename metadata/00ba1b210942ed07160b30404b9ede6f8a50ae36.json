The songs on the EP were initially intended to be part of a re-release of Gaga's debut album The Fame. However, Gaga announced that the new songs would be available as a stand alone EP, as she thought re-releases were unfair and that, as the EP represents a separate conceptual and musical body of work, it does not need the songs of The Fame to support it.\n\n(But she did it anyway and re-released it with the Fame) \n\nCD1\n\nBad Romance\nAlejandro\nMonster\nSpeechless\nDance in the Dark\nTelephone \nSo Happy I Could Die\nTeeth\n\nCD2\n\nJust Dance\nLove Game\nPaparrazi\nPoker Face\nI Like It Rough\nEh Eh [Nothing Else I Can Say]\nStarstruck\nBeautiful, Dirty, Rich\nThe Fame\nMoney Honey\nBoys Boys Boys\nPaper Gangsta\nBrown Eyes\nSummerboy\nDisco Heaven\nRetro Dance Freak\n\n",
