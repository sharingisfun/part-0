On this chilly February day, a woman in orange, hair dyed blue, chats him up: she's Clementine, he's Joel, shy and sad; by day's end, he likes her. The next night she takes him to the frozen Charles River. After, as he drops her off, she asks to sleep at his place, and she runs up to get her toothbrush. Strange things occur: their meeting was not entirely chance, they have a history neither remembers. Our seeing how the lacunae came to be and their discovery of the memory loss take the rest of the film.\n\n  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº              The.Dreamers.Uncut.Limited.DVDRiP.DiVX-DVL                 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº\n  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº                                                                         ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº\n  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°                                                    Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²                                                                         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±  Release Date:     08/30/04        Video Bitrate:    767 kBit/s XViD   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°  DVD Retail Date:  09/28/04        Audio Quality:    vbr mp3 448 6ch\n     Film Genre:       Drama           Video Resolution: 576 x 304            Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°\n     MPEG4 Codec Type: XViD            Release Size:     98x15Mb\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°  DVD Runtime:      107 Mins (R1)   Video Framerate:  23.970FPS\n     IMDB Rating:      8.6/10          Subtitles:        ENG/FRENCH/ESP\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²                                                                         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²\n  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° [Theatre Date] Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°                                          Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²                                                                         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±  Theatre date: (2004)                                                   Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°                                                                         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°\n  ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°  [Plot Summary] Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°                                          Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Âº\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²                                                                         Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²\n  Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±    Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend \n       Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous \n       relationship erased.
