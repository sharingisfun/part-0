Concise explanations, focused examples, step-by-step instructions, and an engaging hands-on tutorial make this book the perfect way to learn Revit Architecture. In addition, you can download starting files for each chapter from the website in order to compare your work to the authors, or start fresh with any chapter in the book.\n\nExpert author Eric Wing first introduces the interface and Revit conventions, and then moves directly into building modeling. You'll learn to place walls, doors, and windows, work with structural grids, beams, and foundations; add text and dimensions, and use dimensions as a design tool. As the building takes shape, you'll discover how to generate construction documentation, create schedules, work with families, consider site issues, and use Revit's rendering capabilities. Here are some of the skills you can acquire from this book:\n\nUnderstanding Revit's interface, views, and grids\nCreating and editing roofs, railings, stairs, and ceilings\nGenerating documentation and construction schedules\nUsing advanced features like creating hosted families, system families, and formulas\n\nAutodesk Revit Architecture: No Experience Required is a completely self-paced guide. You can work along with the tutorial from cover to cover or jump in anywhere. No matter how you use this book, you'll be able to transfer the useful concepts to your professional practice.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8d9df9e39a16c0be2cd61760227265fd20edf7","amp;dn":"Autodesk+Revit+Architecture+2015%2C+No+Experience+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a8d9df9e39a16c0be2cd61760227265fd20edf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,141,157,249,227,154,22,192,190,44,214,23,96,34,114,101,253,32,237,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
