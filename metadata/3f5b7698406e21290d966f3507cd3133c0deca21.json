  "description": "Building Doors and Drawers: A Complete Guide to Design and Construction \n2007\nAndy Rae \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1561588687\nISBN-13: 978-1561588688\n\nThe face of any cabinet, whether in a kitchen, bath, built-in or stand-alone furniture is the doors and drawers. They, along with moldings or trim, define the style of a cabinet. Beyond the wide variety of stylistic differences, there are dozens of ways to build drawers or doors. And different methods have specific applications, depending on the use of the cabinet. While it's easy to learn how to build a basic cabinet box, making durable, well-fitting, and attractive doors and drawers is more challenging. This book covers all styles and methods of building drawers and doors, as well as installing hardware and design. This is the only book on the market that also covers full size doors, an especially useful feature since custom doors are extremely expensive. Because of the wide application of cabinetmaking, this book will appeal equally to carpenters and woodworkers",
