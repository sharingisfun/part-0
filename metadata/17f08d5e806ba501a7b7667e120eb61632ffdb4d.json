  "description": "Lead your people to a new frontier!\n\nSid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a new science-fiction-themed entry into the award-winning Civilization series.

Explore and colonize an alien planet, research new technologies, amass mighty armies, build incredible Wonders and shape the face of your new world.
