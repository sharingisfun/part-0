  "description": "BEACHBODY'S BODY BEAST HOME FITNESS WORKOUT SYSTEM - X264 - MP4 - DVDRIP\n\nAll Workouts are included including documentation, workout schedules and hybrid workout schedules with other Beachbody videos.\n\nAll ads have been removed and Sagi's Intros have been moved to it's own folder as you might not want to see those more than once.\n\nThis version is fully compatible with almost all devices that support x264, MP4 including Softmodded Wiis. These videos have been encoded to support maximum devices, with good quality at low file sizes.\n\nABOUT BODY BEAST\n\nBody Beast Workout Principle: Dynamic Set Training\n\nAll of the BODY BEAST workouts are based on the principle of Dynamic Set Training, which Sagi has developed based on a unique combination of old school and new school bodybuilding techniques. Before we get into the individual workouts, I wanted to go through each type of training set that you will see in BODY BEAST. You have probably seen some of these, but you most likely havent mixed them together like Sagi has done here!\n\nSingle Sets: 1 exercise only\n\nSuper Sets: Any 2 exercise movements done back-to-back without rest\n\nGiant Sets: 3 exercise movements, done back-to-back and all target the same muscle group\n\nMulti-Sets: 3 exercises that dont target similar muscle groups\n\nForce Sets: 5 sets of 5 reps, with 10 seconds of rest between each set\n\nProgressive Sets: A pyramid that goes from high reps to low reps, takes a break, then back up to high reps. Example: 15 reps, 12 reps, 8 reps Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 90 second rest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8 reps, 12 reps, 15 reps.\n\nCombo Sets: Compound exercises, which is any exercise that works more than one muscle group using more than one joint.\n\nCircuit Sets: Moving from one exercise to another without rest\n\nTempo Sets: Holds a contraction for a given amount of time. Example: 6 seconds of concentric action, then 6 seconds of eccentric action.\n\nThe Workout Blocks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BODY BEAST Workout Schedule\n \n\nBLOCK 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BUILD Series\n\nThe BUILD series is going to focus on synergistic muscle groups. That means muscle that work together like chest and triceps, back and biceps, etcÃ¢â‚¬Â¦What these training series allow you to do is get strong and build a solid foundation to work on. Remember what Steve Edwards said when developing P90X2; Ã¢â‚¬Å“You cant fire a canon from a canoeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. These workouts are going to use the best of Ã¢â‚¬Å“old-school bodybuildingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ techniques in the most time-efficient way. But also in a way that promotes intensity, a challenge, and brings you innovative ways of doing these old school moves! When the BUILD Series is used before the BULK Series in the next block, this produces an extremely powerful mass-building effect!\n\nBUILD: Chest/Tris\n\nFocused on the muscles of your chest and triceps, a combination of Super, Giant, and Single Sets will create strength and definition. Time: 48:53\nBUILD: Back/Bis\n\nCreate that Ã¢â‚¬Å“VÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shape with bigger lats, traps, rhomboids, and biceps. You are going to see lots of pulling and curling! Time: 50:05\nBUILD: Legs\n\nFocused on building powerful quads, hamstrings, calves, and glutes. Time: 38:19\nBUILD: Shoulders\n\nFocused on creating the perfect diamond shaped deltoids. Time: 38:19\n \n\nBlock 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BULK Series\n\nThese workouts are going to take what you have built with old-school bodybuilding techniques in the BUILD phase and now focus on Ã¢â‚¬Å“new-schoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ techniques. Some of the new-school techniques are: keeping the muscles under tension for 40 to 70 seconds rather than focusing on reps alone. You will use both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscles for greater testosterone production. You will get closer to 1 minute rest between sets. And the workouts will only last 30 to 60 minutes to further maximize testosterone production.\n\nBULK: Chest\n\nUses Super Sets, Force Sets, Progressive Sets, Combo Sets, and Multi-Sets with an increase in resistance to help bulk you pecs. The pec is a fan shaped muscle and with different angle and exercises, you will be able to hit all the different fibers in that fan shape. The addition of Progressive sets is going to focus on muscular hypertrophy. Time: 30:07\nBULK: Back\n\nUses Super Sets and Force Sets with an increase in resistance to create a massive back. The addition of Force Sets creates a focus on hypertrophy. Time: 29:05\nBULK: Shoulders\n\nSuper Sets and Progressive Sets that focus on the posterior delt (the back of the shoulder), creates a more 3D appearance. Added weight and lower reps pronounce the hypertrophy effect. Time: 35:20\nBULK: Arms\n\nFocused training with Progressive Set, Force Sets and Super Sets to create huge biceps and triceps. Time 35:37\nBULK: Legs\n\nProgressive Sets, Force Sets, and Super Sets will help you build massive quads, hams, and calves. Time 41:14\n \n\nBlock 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BEAST Series\n\nNow its time to BEAST UP! You are going to see a lot of changes in Block 3 of BODY BEAST. Your nutrition has changed in order to shed fat and cut up. These workouts are going to focus on the same thing, getting you cut. The pace will increase, the training moves will change and you are going to sweat! In this series you are literally going to be able to feel your muscles grow because they have no choice!\n\nBEAST: Abs\n\nWe all know that abs arent just for washing your laundry. A strong core is essential for lifting heavier weights safely and helps to improve your posture. Time: 10:32\nBEAST: Cardio\n\nThis is a performance oriented cardio workout that will not only help you cut, but it will also increase your ability to get bigger! Time: 30:10\nBEAST: Total Body\n\nA circuit routine for you entire body. This workout is great to use as a makeup when youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦miss a workout (gasp!) Time: 38:36\n \n\nOptional Workouts\n\nTEMPO: Chest/Tris\nUses Tempo Sets to promote hypertrophy where you can feel your muscles grow. Time: 52:24\n\nTEMPO: Back/Bis\nSame as above, just a different muscle group. Time: 48:25\n\nLUCKY 7\nSeven exercises, seven pyramids, seven time more gains! Similar to Total Body, this workout can be done anytime the schedule calls for a full body workout, or to make up for a missed workout. Time: 22:38",
