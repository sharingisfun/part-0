In \nfact, any of the computer labs that fall under our care must have Faronics Deep \nFreeze installed. Our computer technicians love it; it's the only way they can \nmanage the labs in addition to the user computers. Deep Freeze seriously reduces \nthe number of support calls we receive. The lab monitors have learned they can \nreboot and fix 99% of the issues.
