  "description": "About the game:\n=====================\nRebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville is a strategy sim game with a good helping of narrative and dark humor. It's a thoughtful game that'll make you fond of your survivors before you send them to their deaths for the greater good. As you expand your fort to new buildings, you'll decide between farms or fortifications, housing or hospitals, and make tough decisions to fend off raiders, illness, starvation, and madness. And the dead are still out there wandering the streets, hungrier than ever.\n\nGangs of Deadsville is the third of Sarah Northway's Rebuild series, and the first one available as a full PC downloadable. It's a totally new, much bigger game than the first two.\n\n\nFeatures:\n=====================\n4X style strategy and city (re)building\nEndless replayability with randomized cities and events\nSurvivors with individual skills, perks, relationships, and stories\nRival NPC forts with their own agendas, friendly or otherwise\nStrategic fort defense and interactive attacks\nPlay in either real-time or turn-based mode\n\n\nVersion:\n=====================\nGame version 1.1.1 or GOG setup 2.2.0.3 from June 23, 2015\n\n\nInstructions:\n=====================\nLaunch Setup and Install\nPlay - Enjoy - Seed!\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n=====================\nProcessor: 1.6Ghz\nVideo card: Most cards with drivers newer than 2009\nSystem memory: 1 GB RAM \nOperating system: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8\nHard disk drive: 200 MB available space \n\n\n\n\n             If you enjoyed the game then share with others by seeding\n                        Remember to support quality games",
