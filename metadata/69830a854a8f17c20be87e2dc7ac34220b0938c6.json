  "description": "The Sims 4 glitch free+dlc's unlocked[Origins] Multi17 repack Mr DJ\n\nLOSSLESS Repack by Mr DJ (Me)\nThe Sims 4 Deluxe Edition Multi 17 + dlc's unlocked\n\nRepack features:\n\nDo not cut/recode;\nGame Version - 1.0.677.20;\nLanguage : English (all other languages are present);\nRegistry included: Yes;\nPrecracked - install and play (Origin is required[OFFLINE]);\nInstall Time - 13 minutes [Quad Core];\nFinal size: 8.64gb;\nCrack based on: 3DM version 6\nOperating system: Win XP,Win Vista,Win 7,Win 8,Win 8.1 (both 32bit and 64bit);\n\nThis release is version 1.06.677.20 (update 2) which is free from all previous bugs/glitches till now like the pixel/mosaic bug, it doesn't crashes on launch(CTD) , neither does it have any random crash, YOU CAN VISIT ANY TOWN WITHOUT GAME BEING CRASHING TO DESKTOP. Game is optimized well to run on laptops as well. Enjoy a pleasant experience with this release. It's advised to save game after every 45minutes.\n\nYes it works on all Windows 32bit edition, i have tested it on Windows 7 32bit without any crash. But i have not tested it on windows XP, but it should run if u meet the system requirements.\n\nDLC Content Deluxe Edition: \nÃ‚Â»Life of the Party Digital Content \nÃ‚Â»Up All Night Digital Content \nÃ‚Â»Awesome Animal Hats Digital Content \nÃ‚Â»The Sims 4 Digital Soundtrack \nÃ‚Â»The Sims 4 Creators Guide (Book)\n\nAlways open the game using 'Run as administrator' to avoid any crash/savegame issue....\n\nA simple language changer for 32bit and 64bit OS with instructions has been included.\n\nThe dlc unlock message will come when you'll open the game for the first time.\n\nNo patches/crack required to be applied by yourself i this release, just install and play.\nFor future patches/cracks, i'll upload links here or you can try yourself patching/updating it.\n\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nIf u already had any version of Sims 4 installed, uninstall it and make sure there is no 'The Sims 4' folder in (My) DocumentsElectronic Arts directory after uninstalling the game.\n\nDISABLE YOUR ANTIVIRUS BEFORE RUNNING SETUP (IMPORTANT) as the antivirus will mark 'setup' as a suspicious file,, making it unable to launch setup or may run it but with some glitches,, same for uninstall.....(For avast users: Disable DeepScreen in antivirus settings)...Latest 'Dotnetframe' is required to run the setup (provided)\n\nPlease understand '3DM.dll' is not a virus, if your antivirus reports it, it's a false positive, no harm will be done to your system.\n\nAfter running setup,, click on 'Configure',, specify the install directory,, click on next and next,, select the necessary software (Direct X,visual c++ x86,visual c++ x64[not for x86 users] and Origin [provided in Redist folder]),, again next,, finally on 'Install'...Game will start installing after Origin is installed...\n\nAfter Origin is installed, it'll open, you need to create a account (fake) , just click on 'create an account', fill the details, click on continue, finally click on 'Creat Account' on the page after filling the details , after that no need to verify your email,  just click on 'Origin' (on upper left corner) and then select 'Go Offline'. Now just minimise it (don't close it) and OPEN THE GAME FROM DESKTOP SHORTCUT using 'Run as administrator' OR open 'The.Sims.4.Launcher.exe' using 'Run as administrator' from the installed directoryGameBin folder....U don't need to activate it. Just open 'Origin' in offline mode everytime u run the game.\n\nIf it still crashes, lower the graphics settings from options ingame and make sure you meet the system requirements. There is a 'laptop mode' for running it on low end laptops. I run it on a laptop on ultra settings without this mode. It's much better optimised than Sims 3.\n\nDon't download any cracks or open links from unknown people in comments section. That can sure harm your PC.\n\nIf you still are unable to get it working, feel free to ask here or drop a comment on my facebook page.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE REPACK,, GIVE FEEDBACK AND SEED.......\n\nLIKE THE GAME,, BUY IT AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS.......\n\nCheck out my Official facebook page\nLike it guys to support and get updates on upcoming repacks.....
