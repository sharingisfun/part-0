B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song \nof Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the \nfirst of which is titled A Game of Thrones. Filmed in a Belfast studio \nand on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Scotland, Croatia, \nIceland and Morocco, it premiered on HBO in the United States on April \n17, 2011. Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO \nrenewed Game of Thrones for a fifth and sixth season.\n\nSeven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. \nPolitical and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of \nWesteros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of \nthe King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand \nwas assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. \nMeanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to \ntake power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed \nruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. \nThe friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and with \nthe remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to \nfull-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest \nnorth. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order \nof misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of \nmen and icy horrors beyond.\n\nContainer.......: mkv\nFile Size.......: 2,65 GB (272 MB per episode) - Episodes\n                  672 MB - Bonus Features\nVideo...........: resolution 720x406 (16:9, x264)\nVideo Quality...: Constant RF: 20,0\nAudio 1.........: 2.0 channels (aac, 128 kbps)\nAudio 2,3.......: 1.0 channels (aac, 32 kbps - commentaries)\nAudio Language..: English / Valyrian\nFrame Rate......: 25,00 fps\nSource..........: DVD Box Set (PAL)\nBonus Features..: Included*\nSample..........: Yes\n\n* There are 11 optional audio commentaries (described in Commentaries.txt)\n\nSoft-Coded Subs.: \n\nSeparate SRTs...: English (for non-English dialogue only),\n                  English, English for the Hearing Impaired\n                  \nVobSub..........: English, French, Spanish, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Dutch,\n                  Danish, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Norwegian, Portuguese,\n                  Romanian, Swedish, Turkish\n\nBonus Features..: English (VobSub)  \n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1k2fdqbxq/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1k2fdqbxq/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEPISODE LIST:\n\nS04E01 Two Swords\nS04E02 The Lion And The Rose\nS04E03 Breaker Of Chains\nS04E04 Oathkeeper\nS04E05 First Of His Name\nS04E06 The Laws Of God And Men\nS04E07 Mockingbird\nS04E08 The Mountain And The Viper\nS04E09 The Watchers On The Wall\nS04E10 The Children",
