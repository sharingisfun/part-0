  "description": "What's New in Photoshop CC 14.2\n\nThis update to Photoshop CC (version 14.2) includes many new features, including Perspective Warp for manipulating multiple perspectives in an image, and linked Smart Objects for easier reuse of design elements. We are also delighted to deliver support for 3D printing in Photoshop CC. Now you can design, edit and print in 3D using the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best imaging tool.\n\nWe are excited to announce that we are resetting the trial clock for everyone today. Even if you have previously tried Photoshop CC and your trial has expired, now you can try the latest version of Photoshop CC for an additional 30 days and test-drive these awesome new features.\n\nPerspective Warp makes it easy to manipulate multiple perspectives in your image while keeping the rest of the image intact. You can correct complex distortions that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be fixed with other tools, turn a telephoto-lens shot into a wide-angle shot (and vice-versa), or even change the viewpoint from which the object is seen. Perspective Warp is also fantastic for seamlessly combining multiple images together that have different vanishing points.\n\nSmart Objects just got a lot more useful in Photoshop CC. Similar to Illustrator and InDesign, linked Smart Objects allow you to use the same object in multiple documents, change it once, and have that change flow through to each and every Photoshop document, saving tons of time and improving team collaboration. This works with Illustrator files, PDFs, and even raw photos from Lightroom. Using linked Smart Objects can also reduce the size of your Photoshop files, saving hard disk space.\n\nBring your 3D designs into the real world now that you can easily refine, preview and then print them to a 3D printerÃ¢â‚¬â€all directly from within Photoshop CC. This is especially useful for those who want to use familiar Photoshop tools to edit existing models, including those made in other 3D modeling tools. Get a successful print every time with automatic mesh repair, and automatic generation of support structures. And if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a 3D printer, use the 3D printing service from Shapeways and get your high-quality printed item shipped directly to you.\n\nJDI Features/Enhancements\n-Mercury Graphics Engine performance boost (Smart Sharpen on GPU)\n-Enhanced Scripted Patterns and Fills (Trees, previews, and other improvements)\n-Added a Ã¢â‚¬Å“do not show againÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ checkbox to the missing fonts dialog\n-Enabled Share on Behance for more languages\n-Improved history states for editing text, editing and applying Character and Paragraph styles\n-Generator can export padding in image assets by using layer masks\n-Layer names can now be up to 255 characters\n-Generator now properly rescales Illustrator Smart Objects when exported at 200%\n-New option for Narrow Options Bar, for small displays\n-On a background layer, one click on the lock icon unlocks the layer\n-Set custom background color in New Document dialog\n-Better negative number support in curves adjustments\n-See recent colors in the Swatches panel\n-Change Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clear AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for the Color Sampler tool\n-Increase number of color samplers from 4 to 10\n-Change all color samplers in Info palette at the same time\n-Improved font transformations\n-Improved selection of shapes with white arrow tool (clicking in the middle reveals white knots)\n\nNotable Bug Fixes\n-Generator stability improvements\n-Fix for a crash while using Color Picker or Layer Styles\n-Fixed renaming of a path to playback action properly\n-Fixed Ctrl/Cmd-J merging multiple shape layers into a single new layer\n-Fixed skewing horizontally for live shapes\n-Fixed Layer in hidden (invisible) group is selected when auto-select layers is set\n-Fixed changing tracking values for font selection returns different results from selected value\n\nSystem requirements\n\n- IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â® 4 or AMD AthlonÃ‚Â® 64 processor (2GHz or faster)\n- MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® 7 with Service Pack 1 or Windows 8 (32 and 64 bit)\n- 1GB of RAM\n- 2.5GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices)\n- 1024x768 display (1280x800 recommended) with OpenGLÃ‚Â® 2.0, 16-bit color, and 512MB of VRAM (1GB recommended)*\n- Internet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, membership validation, and access to online services.\n\nLanguages : English, French, Turkish, Russian, Hungarian, Polish, Ukrainian, Czech\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html&lt;/a&gt;",
