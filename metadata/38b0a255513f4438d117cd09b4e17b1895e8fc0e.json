In fact, it's believed that one week's worth of the New York Times contains more information than people 100 years ago encountered in their entire lives. We've all experienced the frustration of an ever-growing reading list, struggling to learn a new language, or forgetting things you learned in even your favorite subjects.\nAnyone can develop Super-Learning skills\n\nThis course is about improving your ability to learn new skills or information quickly and effectively. We go far beyond the kinds of &quot;speed-reading&quot; (or glorified skimming) you may have been exposed to, diving into the actual cognitive and neurological factors that make learning easier and more successful. We also give you advanced memory techniques to grapple with the huge loads of information you'll be able to process.\n\nYou'll learn how to input and retain information in a whole new way - a faster, better way\nThe core of this SuperLearning course involves 3 &quot;super skills&quot;:\n\nSpeed-reading with high (80%+) comprehension and understanding\nMemory techniques for storing and recalling vast amounts of information quickly and accurately\nDeveloping the cognitive infrastructure to support this flood of new information long-term\n\nHowever, the SuperLearning skills you'll learn in this course are applicable to many aspects of your every day life, from remembering phone numbers to acquiring new skills or even speaking new languages.\nHow we'll teach you SuperLearning and advanced memory techniques\n\nThe sad irony is that in order to learn most of these superlearning skills and memory techniques in the past, you had to read dozens of books and psychological journals. Or, you had to hire an expensive private tutor who specializes in superlearning. That's what I did. And it changed my life.\n\nFortunately, my instructors (experts in the fields of superlearning, memory techniques, and speed-reading) have agreed to help me transform their materials into the first ever digital course.\n\nWe've designed a course based heavily on video-lectures and a great deal at-home exercises. The lecture components are only a small part of this superlearning course - you will be practicing various exercises and assignments on a regular basis. The course will require 2-3 hours of memory and speed-reading practice and training per week and training, and last roughly 4-6 weeks. It won't be easy - but if you put in the work, you are guaranteed to succeed.\n\nIn addition to the lectures, there is an additional 1.5 hours of supplemental video content from TED, YouTube, and other sources which are considered part of the course curriculum.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38b0a255513f4438d117cd09b4e17b1895e8fc0e","amp;dn":"Udemy+-+Become+a+SuperLearner+Learn+Speed+Reading+And+Advanced+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38b0a255513f4438d117cd09b4e17b1895e8fc0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,176,162,85,81,63,68,56,209,23,205,9,180,225,123,24,149,232,252,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
