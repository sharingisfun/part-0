  "description": "                                     Dexter\n                             +++ HDTV (XviD/MP3) +++\n                              The Complete Season 6\n\n\nMeet Dexter Morgan. By day he's a blood splatter pattern expert for the Miami Metro police department. But by night - he takes on an entirely different persona: serial killer. But Dexter isn't your average serial killer as he only kills people who fit a very prolific and precise &quot;moral code&quot; taught to him by his late father Harry (he didn't kill Harry, honest), and developed very thoroughly throughout each kill.\n\nIn Season 6 the explosively popular DEXTER is back with a vengeance for a series of startling suspense and unexpected twists. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been a year since last seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shocking and heartbreaking conclusion, and mild mannered criminologist-cum-grisly serial killer Dexter Morgan has come to terms with who he is. But his existence is shattered when he crosses paths with an enemy unlike any heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faced before. A delusional religious zealot with unflinching convictions, this new adversary soon draws Dexter into a dangerous game that could well end in disaster.\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t350 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t42 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976 fps\nAudio:  \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t12 + 2 Teaser + 1 txt = 13\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/man-o-tor/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
