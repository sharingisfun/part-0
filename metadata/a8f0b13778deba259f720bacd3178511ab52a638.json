  "description": "Physics Curiosities, Oddities, and Novelties\nby John Kimball\nCRC Press | April 2015 | ISBN-10: 1466576359 | PDF | 380 pages | 19.7 mb\n\nAn Enlightening Way to Navigate through Mind-Boggling Physics Concepts\nPhysics Curiosities, Oddities, and Novelties highlights unusual aspects of physics and gives a new twist to some fundamental concepts. The book covers both classical and modern physics in an engaging, straightforward style.\nThe author presents perplexing questions that often lack satisfying answers. He also delves into the stories of famous and eccentric past scientists. Many examples reveal interesting ideas, including how:\n-   Newton had trouble determining the mass of the moon\n-   An electric motor is an electric generator run in reverse\n-   Time travel that violates causality is not possible\n-   SchrÃƒÂ¶dingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cat may be both dead and alive, and there may be two of each one of us to observe the two possibilities\n-   Particle physics and the basic laws of thermodynamics can appear simple yet are very complicated\nAccessible to nonspecialists and beginning students, this book provides insight into physics using minimal mathematics and jargon. It summarizes many fascinating aspects of physics employing only essential formulas. Some familiar formulas are written in standard form while other equations are written in words for greater clarity.\n\nAbout the Author\nJohn Kimball is a professor emeritus of physics at the University at Albany, SUNY. His research has largely focused on condensed matter physics, including high-energy electron-positron pair production in crystals, exact solutions of a kinetic model of magnetism, relations between chaos and symmetry, and studies of magnetic impurities. Dr. Kimball is an enthusiastic sailor and author of the highly praised book Physics of Sailing. He earned a PhD from the University of Chicago.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface xv\nAbout the Author xvii\nChapter 1 Newton and Mechanics 1\nChapter 2 Momentum, Angular Momentum, and Energy 39\nChapter 3 Thermal Physics 77\nChapter 4 Electromagnetism 105\nChapter 5 Waves 147\nChapter 6 Quantum 191\nChapter 7 Materials and Devices 225\nChapter 8 Relativity 259\nChapter 9 Nucleus 279\nChapter 10 Particle Physics 293\nChapter 11 Nobel Laureates: A Short Summmmary 307\nAnnotated Bibliography 329\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/ifc9w27mn/Physics_Curiosities_Oddities_and_Novelties.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/ifc9w27mn/Physics_Curiosities_Oddities_and_Novelties.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
