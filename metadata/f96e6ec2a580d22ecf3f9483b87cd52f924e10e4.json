For some reason in the past several months IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a bit more attracted to female vocalists than I usually am (I blame and thank Polica for that) and Daughter really turned my head in terms of the song style and vocals. There are currently two releases out there, including His Young Heart and The Wild Youth, both of which are filled with sparse guitar, piano, and somewhat experimental swells of sound and electronic accents. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the vocals, and instrumentation that really stand out, with her voice alternating between heavily saturated reverb, and quite moments of barely-sung phrases. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really something unique and I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough of it. The song Landfill, posted below, is the first song I heard and I was right to expect equally great songs from her. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a Spotify user, links to both albums available are posted below.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.randomtransmission.com/daughter-his-young-heart/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.randomtransmission.com/daughter-his-young-heart/&lt;/a&gt;\n\njust love it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96e6ec2a580d22ecf3f9483b87cd52f924e10e4","amp;dn":"Daughter+-+His+Young+Heart+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96e6ec2a580d22ecf3f9483b87cd52f924e10e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,110,110,194,165,128,210,46,207,63,148,131,184,124,213,47,146,78,16,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
