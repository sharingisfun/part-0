  "description": "IK Multimedia T-RackS CS Complete v4.6 WiN\n\n\n\n\n\nClose your eyes and picture a store full of cool processing gear: compressors and limiters are in a rack over here, EQs are over there Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tube, solid state, digital Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you name it, this storeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got it all. There are reverbs, de-essers, multiband processors, and a shelf full of vintage emulations. In short, a candy store of tone for recording musicians, engineers, and producers.\n\nJust a gear geekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasy? Nope, this store is very real, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available to you 24/7. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the new T-RackS Custom Shop, where you can browse a huge collection of IKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-quality processing plug-ins for mixing and mastering, and purchase only the ones you want, when you want them. And the best part is, you can get started without spending a dime by downloading T-RackS Custom Shop.\n\n\n\n\n\nFree gear\n\nYou can find the T-RackS Custom Shop free software in the IK User Area, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice after installing it that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve given you two free plug-ins. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t beat that deal! You get the Classic Equalizer module, a 6-band parametric mastering EQ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part of the T-RackS Classic bundle, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also provided you with the T-RackS Metering Suite, which contains a host of useful and detailed displays including Peak, Perceived Loudness, Phase, and RMS meters, plus a Spectrum analyzer with Peak, RMS and Averaging indicators. Both the EQ and meters can be instantiated as separate plug-ins in your DAW, or as part of the integrated T-RackS shell, which features 8 plug-in slots, and allows you to chain up to 12 processors.\n\nYou can also run the T-RackS integrated module as a standalone program, from which you can master your mixes. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re running standalone or as a plug-in, the Custom Shop can be accessed from inside of T-RackS.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nWindowsÃ‚Â® (32 and 64 bit)\n   Minimal: IntelÃ‚Â® Pentium 4Ã‚Â® 2.4 GHz or IntelÃ‚Â® CoreÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Duo or AMD AthlonÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 64,\n   1 GB of RAM, WindowsÃ‚Â® XP, WindowsÃ‚Â® Vista, WindowsÃ‚Â® 7 or WindowsÃ‚Â® 8.\n   Supported Plug-in formats: VST, RTAS, AAX (32 and 64-bit).\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\n\n01.Uninstall previous versions.\n02.Install the software.\n03.Run our keygen.\n04.Select a product.\n05.Push &quot;Register This Computer.\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
