Her current work in monitoring for extraterrestrial life is based on that love and is in part an homage to her father. Ever since funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) was pulled on her work, which is referred to some, including her NSF superior David Drumlin, as more science fiction than science, Ellie, with a few of her rogue scientist colleagues, have looked for funding from where ever they could get it to continue their work. When Ellie and her colleagues hear chatter originating from the vicinity of the star Vega, Ellie feels vindicated. But that vindication is short lived when others, including politicians, the military, religious leaders and other scientists such as Drumlin.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.min.us/iknFpi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.min.us/iknFpi.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.min.us/iksbT6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.min.us/iksbT6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.min.us/iknDha.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.min.us/iknDha.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95fbac135060d6f82caa5a5d8990a10ab8babbad","amp;dn":"Contact+%281997%29+720p+BrRip+mkv+-+600MB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95fbac135060d6f82caa5a5d8990a10ab8babbad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,251,172,19,80,96,214,248,44,170,90,93,137,144,161,10,184,186,187,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
