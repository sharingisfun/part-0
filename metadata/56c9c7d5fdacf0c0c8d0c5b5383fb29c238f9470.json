Hope you guys enjoy and please help seed.\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nChangelog for Democracy 3 1.14: \n\nGUI Changes: \nThe list of mods now shows green for enabled and red for disabled in both the list and the selected mod. \nThe delete mod button ahs been moved to the mod details screen. \nMain menu and loading screen now supports screen resolutions larger than 2048 width better. \nPolling screen, New policy screen and achievements screen are now larger on high resolutions. \nMinimum res (1024) now no longer crops the voter type names on the polls screen. \n\n\n----------\n\n\nWhat's cool about it:\n\nIncludes 33 new situations and policies!\n\nWork to maintain the support of your people while you bring into law extremist policies!\n\nNow's your chance to see what happens when you enact far right or left policies; will your country become a utopia or a dictatorship in everything but name?\n\nOverview:\n\nDemocracy 3: Extremism adds 33 new situations and policies that reflect the more extreme side of politics, all within the framework of a democracy. Fed up with just adjusting taxes and government spending in the conventional sense? Perhaps you think your people need the national anthem sung at the start of every news broadcast? Or maybe what they are crying out for is a ban on divorce, or same-sex relationships? Alternatively you might like to close your countries airports to save the environment, or maybe outright ban private education?\n\nHow far to the extremes can you take your country and still maintain the support of the people (and avoid some of them putting a gun to your head). Democracy 3:Extremism, for when fiddling with tax rates simply isn't enough!",
