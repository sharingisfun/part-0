He would be asked by Belgian King Leopold to go to Africa to see what he has done there to help the country. Initially he refuses. But an American, George Washington Williams wants him to accept so he can accompany him. He says that Leopold might be committing all sorts of atrocities to achieve his goal like slavery. He needs to prove it. Clayton agrees and his wife insists that she accompany him because she misses Africa. They go and when they arrive a man named Rom who works for Leopold attacks the village they are at and captures Tarzan and Jane. With Washington's help he escapes and sets out to rescue Jane by going across the jungle and Washington joins him despite being told that he might not make it.\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n       \r\nFormat.......: Matroska\r\nFile Size....: 2.77 GiB\r\nDuration.....: 1h 49mn\r\nBitrate......: 3 604 Kbps\r\nSource.......: BluRay\r\nEncoder&quot;.......JYK\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0918940/\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Format......: AVC\r\nVideo Codec.......: x264 core 148 r2638 7599210     \r\nBitrate...........: 2 850 Kbps\r\nFrame Rate........: 23.976 fps\r\nWidth.............: 1 920 pixels\r\nHeight............: 800 pixels\r\naspect ratio......: 2.40:1\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat..........: DTS\r\nBitrate.........: 755 Kbps\r\nChannels........: 6 channels\r\nSampling Rate...: 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage........: English\r\n\r\n\r\nSubtitles\r\n\r\nCodec......................
