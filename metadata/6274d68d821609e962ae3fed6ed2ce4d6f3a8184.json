Now this instant classic has been completely updated, outfitted with a whole \nnew arsenal of indispensable knowledge on global affairs, popular culture, economic trends, scientific principles, and modern arts. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your chance to brush up on all \nthose subjects you slept through in school, reacquaint yourself with all the facts you once knew (then promptly forgot), catch up on major developments in the world today, \nand become the Renaissance man or woman you always knew you could be!\n\nHow do you tell the Balkans from the Caucasus? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the difference between fission and fusion? Whigs and Tories? Shiites and Sunnis? Deduction and induction? Why arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t \nall Shakespearean comedies necessarily thigh-slappers? What are transcendental numbers and what are they good for? What really happened in PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cave? Is postmodernism \ndead or just having a bad hair day? And for extra credit, when should you use the adjective continual and when should you use continuous?\n\nAn Incomplete Education answers these and thousands of other questions with incomparable wit, style, and clarity. American Studies, Art History, Economics, Film, \nLiterature, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Religion, Science, and World History: HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the bottom line on each of these major disciplines, \ndistilled to its essence and served up with consummate flair.\n\nIn this revised edition youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a vitally expanded treatment of international issues, reflecting the seismic geopolitical upheavals of the past decade, from \neconomic free-fall in South America to Central AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world war, and from violent radicalization in the Muslim world to the crucial trade agreements that are defining \nglobalization for the twenty-first century. And donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to read the section A Nervous AmericanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Living and Loving on Five Continents before you answer \na personal ad in the International Herald Tribune. \n\nAs delightful as it is illuminating, An Incomplete Education packs ten thousand years of culture into a single superbly readable volume. This is a book to celebrate,\n to share, to give and receive, to pore over and browse through, and to return to again and again.\n\n",
