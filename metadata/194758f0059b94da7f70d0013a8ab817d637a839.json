  "description": "The HBO show True Detective has quickly become one of television's most riveting programs. The gritty crime drama, which stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, follows two troubled, Louisiana homicide detectives as they try to solve the haunting and highly calculated, borderline-Satanic murder of a young prostitute named Dora Lange. \n\nLike many of HBO's famous TV shows, including The Sopranos and Six Feet Under, True Detective has an impeccable soundtrack, one that introduces viewers to many lesser-known acts and songs with a darker edge. \nConsidering the fact that the show's executive music producer and composer is the legendary T Bone Burnett, the show's musical mastery should come as no surprise. Here are some the best musical moments featured so far on the gripping show.\n\n46 songs from 8 episodes in 2014. (Added five missing song from y'day post)",
