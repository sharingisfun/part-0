It was an overnight hit, eventually selling 15 million copies. How to Win Friends and Influence People is just as useful today as it was when it was first published, because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to &quot;the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people.&quot; He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person's point of view and &quot;arousing in the other person an eager want.&quot; You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, &quot;let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers,&quot; and &quot;talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.&quot; Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. --Joan Price\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People is one of the first bestselling self-help books ever published. Written by Dale Carnegie and first published in 1936, it has sold 15 million copies world-wide. Leon Shimkin of the publishing firm Simon &amp; Schuster took one of the 14-week courses given by Carnegie in 1934. Shimkin persuaded Carnegie to let a stenographer take notes from the course to be revised for publication. In 1981, a new revised edition with updated language and anecdotes was released. The revised edition reduced the number of sections from 6 to 4, eliminating sections on effective business letters and improving marital satisfaction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0208735cf3fce96c0a5b9accec844aafc08ceaf6","amp;dn":"How+To+Win+Friends+and+Influence+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0208735cf3fce96c0a5b9accec844aafc08ceaf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,8,115,92,243,252,233,108,10,91,154,204,236,132,74,175,192,140,234,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
