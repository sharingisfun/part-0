  "description": "The Black Keys\nThe Best Of The Black keys (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nIt's too facile to call the Black Keys counterparts of the White Stripes: they share several surface similarities -- their names are color-coded, they hail from the Midwest, they're guitar-and-drum blues-rock duos -- but the Black Keys are their own distinct thing, a tougher, rougher rock band with a purist streak that never surfaced in the Stripes. But that's not to say that the Black Keys are blues traditionalists: even on their 2002 debut, The Big Come Up, they covered the Beatles' psychedelic classic &quot;She Said She Said,&quot; indicating a fascination with sound and texture that would later take hold on such latter-day albums as 2008's Attack &amp; Release, where guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney teamed up with sonic architect Danger Mouse. In between those two records, the duo established the Black Keys as a rock &amp; roll band with a brutal, primal force, and songwriters of considerable depth, as evidenced on such fine albums as 2003's Thickfreakness and 2004's Rubber Factory. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.I'll Be Your Man\n02.Set You Free\n03.Have Love Will Travel\n04.Everywhere I Go\n05.When The Lights Go Out\n06.10 A.M.
