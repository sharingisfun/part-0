  "description": "The Wisdom Of Psychopaths: What Saints.. By Kevin Dutton (Abee)\n_____\n\nThe Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success By Kevin Dutton  (Author)\n___\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KAr0AKSkL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KAr0AKSkL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nOne of SlateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Twenty Overlooked Books of 2012\n\nIn this engrossing journey into the lives of psychopaths and their infamously crafty behaviors, the renowned psychologist Kevin Dutton reveals that there is a scale of Ã¢â‚¬Å“madnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ along which we all sit. Incorporating the latest advances in brain scanning and neuroscience, Dutton demonstrates that the brilliant neurosurgeon who lacks empathy has more in common with a Ted Bundy who kills for pleasure than we may wish to admit, and that a mugger in a dimly lit parking lot may well, in fact, have the same nerveless poise as a titan of industry.\n\nDutton argues that there are indeed Ã¢â‚¬Å“functional psychopathsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ among usÃ¢â‚¬â€different from their murderous counterpartsÃ¢â‚¬â€who use their detached, unflinching, and charismatic personalities to succeed in mainstream society, and that shockingly, in some fields, the more Ã¢â‚¬Å“psychopathicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ people are, the more likely they are to succeed. Dutton deconstructs this often misunderstood diagnosis through bold on-the-ground reporting and original scientific research as he mingles with the criminally insane in a high-security ward, shares a drink with one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful con artists, and undergoes transcranial magnetic stimulation to discover firsthand exactly how it feels to see through the eyes of a psychopath.\n\nAs Dutton develops his theory that we all possess psychopathic tendencies, he puts forward the argument that society as a whole is more psychopathic than ever: after all, psychopaths tend to be fearless, confident, charming, ruthless, and focusedÃ¢â‚¬â€qualities that are tailor-made for success in the twenty-first century. Provocative at every turn, The Wisdom of Psychopaths is a riveting adventure that reveals that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our much-maligned dark side that often conceals the trump cards of success.  \n\nPublisher: Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux (October 16, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9780374291358\nISBN-13: 978-0374291358\nASIN: 0374291357\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
