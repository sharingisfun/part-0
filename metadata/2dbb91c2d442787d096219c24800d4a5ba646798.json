Girls, Girls, Girls (Part 2) - 4:14\n\nThe Blueprint is the sixth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released September 11, 2001 on Roc-A-Fella Records in the United States. Its release was set a week earlier than initially planned in order to combat bootlegging. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2001 at Manhattan Center Studios and Baseline Studios in New York City. Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z's previous work, The Blueprint features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West and Just Blaze. At the time of its recording, Jay-Z was awaiting two criminal trials, one for gun possession and another for assault, and had become one of hip hop's most dissed artists, receiving insults from rappers such as Nas, Prodigy, and Jadakiss. The album is also famous for its producer Kanye West's big breakout as a major producer. Kanye West produced 4 of the 13 tracks on the album, including the iconic track &quot;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&quot; and the controversial track which included diss lyrics aimed at rappers Nas and Prodigy, &quot;Takeover&quot;.",
