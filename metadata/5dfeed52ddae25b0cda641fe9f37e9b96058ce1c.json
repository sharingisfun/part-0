He goes to New Orleans and he unwittingly takes part in a criminal act. He is arrested and sent to jail. He gets out on parole and makes a living by dancing in the streets. But his parole officer tells him to stop it because he's not suppose to be where he goes to dance as part of his parole. The officer tells him to get a job but he only wants to dance. He decides to go back to New York even though he's not allowed to. He goes to his brother Nicky who has a club. He learns that Nicky and his partner Kaz had a falling out when a rich guy convinced Kaz that he doesn't need Nicky. Nicky told Kaz that he's just using him to get to Kaz's sister who is also a performer who is hoping an agent will take her as a client because she could be sent back to Japan where she is from. When Donny sees her, he can't help but be interested in her despite Nicky telling him not to go near her.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536bf4ab04965.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536bf4ab04965.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536bf4ab249ee.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536bf4ab249ee.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536bf4ab50be5.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/536bf4ab50be5.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n",
