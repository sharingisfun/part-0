Bare to the waist, the king kneels to receive a flogging from Saxon monks. He begins to reminisce, recalling at first the carefree, promiscuous adventures with Becket, then his favorite drinking and wenching companion. A violently emotional drama that probes the changing relationship between two young men - between two close friends bound together by similar pride of flesh and spirit who become deadly enemies as they pursue their separate destinies . . . that of king . . . and saint. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8ecf14eb3e866d077c0f00fae72b747087209d","amp;dn":"Becket+%281964%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8ecf14eb3e866d077c0f00fae72b747087209d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,142,207,20,235,62,134,109,7,124,15,0,250,231,43,116,112,135,32,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
