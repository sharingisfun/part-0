Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional rock and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson, the distinctive voice of Hodgson, and the prominent use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone in their songs.\n\nWhile the band's early work was mainstream progressive rock, they would enjoy greater critical and commercial success when they incorporated more conventional and radio-friendly elements into their work in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums. They reached their peak of commercial success with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies.\n\nThough their albums were generally far more successful than their singles, Supertramp did enjoy a number of major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;It's Raining Again&quot; and &quot;Cannonball&quot;. The band attained significant popularity in the United States, Canada, most of Europe, South Africa, Australia, and Brazil. Since Hodgson's departure in 1983, founder Rick Davies has led the band by himself.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBreakfast in America is the sixth album by the band Supertramp, released in 1979. It was recorded the previous year at the Village Recorder in Los Angeles. It featured three U.S. Billboard hit singles: &quot;The Logical Song&quot; (#6), &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; (#15), and &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot; (#10). In the UK, &quot;The Logical Song&quot; and the title track were both top 10 hits, the only two the group had in their native country. Breakfast in America won two Grammy Awards in 1980, and holds an RIAA certification of quadruple platinum.\n\nIn France, the album is the biggest selling English language album of all time, and the third biggest seller overall.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7565e5edeb8faa6f3d36b424306fe4e01ddf6e33","amp;dn":"Supertramp+-+Breakfast+In+America+%5B1979%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7565e5edeb8faa6f3d36b424306fe4e01ddf6e33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,101,229,237,235,143,170,111,61,54,180,36,48,111,228,224,29,223,110,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
