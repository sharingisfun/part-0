Like very nearly every worthwhile thing, making this album was not easy; it was a difficult second album to make. Drawing inspiration from folk/rock from about 1965 to 1973, and Van Morrison s Astral Weeks in particular, Helplessness Blues sees Fleet Foxes heighten and extend themselves, adding instrumentation (clarinet, the music box, pedal steel guitar, lap steel guitar, Tibetan singing bowls, vibraphone, etc., along with more traditional band instrumentation), with a focus on clear, direct lyrics, and an emphasis on group vocal harmonies.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e6589cb28256b94d0a0a7bda234cd1f7d74829","amp;dn":"Fleet+Foxes+-+Helplessness+Blues+%5Bmp3-320-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e6589cb28256b94d0a0a7bda234cd1f7d74829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,230,88,156,178,130,86,185,77,10,10,123,218,35,76,209,247,215,72,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
