Mankind soldiers on, living out a \nhardscrabble life on the surface or holing up in great Vaults built \ninside caves. You're a member of Vault 13 somewhere in Southern California, \nand the Vault Overseer's got a job for you - find a replacement water \npurification chip within 150 days, or your home is doomed.\n\nFallout 2 - It's been 80 long years since your ancestor, the Vault Dweller \ntrod across the wastelands. As you now search for the Garden of Eden \nCreation Kit to save your primitive village, touch choices and even tougher \nconsequences await you.\n\nFallout Tactics Brotherhood of Steel - A departure from the character-heavy \nRPG style of traditional Fallout games, Interplay's Fallout Tactics - \nBrotherhood of Steel is instead a squad-based tactical RPG, utilizing both \nturn-based and real-time mechanics. As part of a split faction of the \nBrotherhood of Steel, the player controls a team that attempts to grow and \nexpand across Fallout's barren wastelands by recruiting outsiders to embark \non combat-heavy missions. Though vastly different from other Fallout titles, \nFallout Tactics is a solid and enjoyable title that fans of the series would \ndo well to explore. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9629866b883fc95612e47e08cc1eb61bdc16cc53","amp;dn":"Fallout+1%2C+2%2C+Tactics+-+MAC+OS+-+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9629866b883fc95612e47e08cc1eb61bdc16cc53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,41,134,107,136,63,201,86,18,228,126,8,204,30,182,27,220,22,204,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
