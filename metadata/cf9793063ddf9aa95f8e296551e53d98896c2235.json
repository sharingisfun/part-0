Once considered little more than a charming oddity, the tiny house movement continues to gain momentum among those who thirst for a simpler, &quot;greener,&quot; more meaningful life in the face of society's &quot;more is better&quot; mindset.\n\nThis book explores the philosophies behind the tiny house lifestyle, helps you determine whether it's a good fit for you, and guides you through the transition to a smaller space. For inspiration, you'll meet tiny house pioneers and hear how they built their dwellings (and their lives) in unconventional, creative and purposeful ways. They'll invite you in, show you around their cozy abodes, and share lessons they learned along the way.\n\nInside you'll find everything you need to design a tiny home of your own:\n\nWorksheets and exercises to help you home in on your true needs, define personal goals, and develop a tiny house layout that's just right for you.\nPractical strategies for cutting through clutter and paring down your possessions.\nGuidance through the world of building codes and zoning laws.\nDesign tricks for making the most of every square foot, including multi-function features and ways to maximize vertical space.\nTours of 11 tiny houses and the unique story behind each.\n\nTiny House Living is about distilling life down to that which you value most...freeing yourself from clutter, mortgages and home maintenance...and, in doing so, making more room in everyday life for the really important things, like relationships, passions and community. Whether you downsize to a 400-square-foot home or simply scale back the amount of stuff you have in your current home, this book shows you how to live well with less.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9793063ddf9aa95f8e296551e53d98896c2235","amp;dn":"Tiny+House+Living%3A+Ideas+For+Building+and+Living+Well+In+Less+th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9793063ddf9aa95f8e296551e53d98896c2235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,151,147,6,61,223,154,169,95,142,41,101,81,229,61,152,137,108,34,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
