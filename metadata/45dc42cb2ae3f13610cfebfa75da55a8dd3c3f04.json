Greg Dulli commented positively about them in more than one place, but few suspected that these homemade tapes would launch one of the biggest modern rock bands of the post-grunge era. As it turns out, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exactly what GrohlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Foo Fighters became, perhaps the one band of the alt-rock revolution to enjoy continual success on the charts and on the road without a dip in popularity. It was this consistency that distinguished the Foos; other bands burned brighter or had bigger hits, but Grohl's band -- which coalesced into a permanent lineup around the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third album -- always climbed into the upper reaches of the charts, churning out singles like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEverlong,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLearn to Fly,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy HeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that built upon the heavy, melodic, loud-quiet-loud template of the Pixies and Nirvana, pushing it ever so slightly toward the realm of classic guitar rock. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.
