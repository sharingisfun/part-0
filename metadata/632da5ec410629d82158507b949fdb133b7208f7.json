  "description": " imageimage\n\nOrphan Black follows outsider, orphan and street-wise chameleon Sarah, who will be portrayed by actress Tatiana Maslany (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Picture DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). After witnessing a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suicide, Sarah assumes the strangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity, who happens to look just like her. Expecting to solve all her problems by cleaning out the dead womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s savings, Sarah is instead thrust headlong into a kaleidoscopic mystery as she realizes the dizzying truth: she and the dead woman are clones.\n\nAs Sarah searches for answers, she discovers the chilling fact that there are more people like her out there Ã¢â‚¬â€ genetically identical individuals who were planted in unsuspecting birth parents and nurtured in completely different circumstances.
