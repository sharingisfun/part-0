  "description": "TITLE/EDITION Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology\nBy: Donald C Rizzo\nPaperback: 576 pages\nPublisher: Cengage Learning; 4 edition (March 20, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1285174151\nISBN-13: 978-1285174150\nNOTE: This is the standalone ebook and may not include access codes that come packaged with the bound book\n\n\n\n\nPacked with vivid illustrations and a wealth of hands-on applications, best-selling FUNDAMENTALS OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, 4E is written specifically for learners in a one-semester introductory A&amp;P course in the allied health field who have little or no previous knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Known for its clear approach to teaching, the text is widely praised for its ability to break A&amp;P down into very simple, easy to understand language. Content is organized according to body systems, and focuses on the body working together to promote homeostasis. Improving both the quality and quantity of text illustrations, the Fourth Edition's new art program brings text concepts to life with new figures throughout. Designed specifically for the needs of health care programs, the all-new Learning Lab's interactive simulation program helps learners maximize their success",
