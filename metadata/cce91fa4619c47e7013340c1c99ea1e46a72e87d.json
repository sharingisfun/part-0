It put the rest of the retro-rock scene on notice: rehash the\npast all you want, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the future.\n\nPrecious few revivalists possess that old black magic to set them apart. But to\na fusion of the classic hard rock and progressive blues of the 60s and 70s,\ngenuine soul and a gutsy groove, Rival Sons add the real X Factor: great, great\nsongs. Such an obvious ingredient, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazing how many others miss it.\n\nRecorded in Nashville with Grammy-nominated producer Dave Cobb (Jamie Johnson,\nShooter Jennings) and Grammy-winning engineer Vance Powell (The White Stripes,\nKings of Leon), Head Down takes the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electrifying blend of Led Zeppelin,\nFree, Bad Company, Deep Purple, The Doors and a dozen others to exhilarating new\nheights. Kick the door in, take no prisoners, ask no questions, play it loud; as\nplans go, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to fault.\n\nKeep on Swinging pretty much sums it up:  big, bold and totally badass, it sets\nthe tone for an album which raises the bar across the board. Sure, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nplenty of hat, but we also get the cattle. The breezy Wild Animal and Until the\nSun Comes contrast nicely with the raunchiness of All the Way and Three Fingers,\nthemselves preludes to the sheer girth of You Want To Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which recalls Zep at\ntheir raucous best Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the mighty Manifest Destiny Pt. 1, a shadowy,\nsmouldering epic that broods like a black hole. Although the inevitable ballads\narenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong suit, both Jordan and True are carried off with\nconfidence and without resorting to slush or schmaltz.\n\nBoth as performers and songwriters, these guys have upped their game, and Head\nDown puts them well ahead of the pack. When the future looks bleak, all we want\nto do is look back, but we owe it to ourselves to make it more than a\nnarcissistic nostalgia trip. Fizzing with freshness, Head Down honours half a\ncentury of classic rock with reverence, respect and the realisation that this\nmusicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still happening, right now.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce91fa4619c47e7013340c1c99ea1e46a72e87d","amp;dn":"Rival++Sons+Head+Down+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce91fa4619c47e7013340c1c99ea1e46a72e87d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,233,31,164,97,156,71,231,1,51,64,193,201,158,161,228,106,114,232,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
