  "description": "SWIM has this book, and we had trouble distributing the files. TPB, problem solved.\n\n/--------------------------------\nOfficial Description\n--------------------------------/\n\nStop wasting your time\nwrestling with incomplete and confusing tutorials\nPiecing together the docs is tough The documentation is not self-explanatory, one tutorial says one thing and another says something completely different.\nBlogs and screencasts only take you so far... There are not any good screencasts or tutorials out there that teach how to maximize the framework. Some teach the basics, but nothing that shows how to put it all together?\nTime is money; don't waste it sifting through blogs.Not only does it take a few trips around the community to have a basic understanding, but it's tough to find the answer you need.\nWhat the heck is a _____? The vocabulary is foreign, when are you supposed to use a directive, a filter, or a factory? And seriously, what the does $apply and $digest mean?\nHow does it all fit together? The internals of AngularJS sparse and few and far between. How do you know how it all fits together?\nStill not hitting deadlines faster. You still have a job to do and learning AngularJS hasn't made it any more achievable\nReady to master AngularJS?\nWhat if you could master the entire framework Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with solid foundations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in less time without beating your head against a wall? Imagine how quickly you could work if you knew the best practices and the best tools?\nStop wasting your time searching and have everything you need to be productive in one, well-organized place, with complete examples to get your project up without needing to resort to endless hours of research.\nYou will learn what you need to know to work professionally with ng-book: The Complete Book on AngularJS\n\n/-------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.ng-book.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.ng-book.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------------/\n",
