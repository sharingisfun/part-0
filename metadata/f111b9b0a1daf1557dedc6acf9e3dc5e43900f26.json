As their lives unexpectedly intersect, they each are about to discover there is power in the Cross of Christ ... even if they don't yet believe it. When a local pastor is shaken to the core by the visible faith of an old street-corner preacher, he is reminded that true belief always requires action. His response ignites a faith-fueled journey that powerfully impacts everyone it touches in ways that only God could orchestrate. This stirring new film from the creators of God's Not Dead arrives in theaters Spring of 2015. More than a movie, it's a question we all must answer in our lifetimes: DO YOU BELIEVE? \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f111b9b0a1daf1557dedc6acf9e3dc5e43900f26","amp;dn":"Do+You+Believe%3F+%282015%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f111b9b0a1daf1557dedc6acf9e3dc5e43900f26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,17,185,176,161,218,241,85,125,237,198,172,249,227,220,94,67,144,15,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
