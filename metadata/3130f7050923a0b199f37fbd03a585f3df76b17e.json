It offers you a perfect introduction to this stimulating activity, beginning with an emphasis on the correct handling of drawing materials and the use of common powers of observation. Whether your interest in freehand drawing is professional or strictly for pleasure, you will find this book a reliable and eminently helpful training guide.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3130f7050923a0b199f37fbd03a585f3df76b17e","amp;dn":"Freehand+Drawing+and+Sketching+%2B+Freehand+Sketching+Tricks+and+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3130f7050923a0b199f37fbd03a585f3df76b17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,48,247,5,9,35,160,177,153,243,127,189,3,165,133,243,223,118,177,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
