Centered around the talents of vocalist Alisa Xayalith and instrumentalist/vocalist Thom Powers, the band formed in 2008 and released two EPs before adding members to play live. In 2010 they released their debut album, Passive Me, Aggressive You, featuring the number one single &quot;Young Blood.&quot; In support of their debut, the band went on a massive world tour, performing some 200 odd dates. With the tour at an end the group found themselves relocating to Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles in 2012 with the aim to write and record their sophomore release. Working with the likes of Thom Powers, Alan Moulder, and Justin Meldal-Johnson, the group announced in 2013 that their second release, In Rolling Waves, would be released that September.",
