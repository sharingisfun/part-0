They became known for energetic live performances which often included instrument destruction. The Who have sold about 100 million records, and have charted 27 top forty singles in the United Kingdom and United States, as well as 17 top ten albums, with 18 Gold, 12 Platinum and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone.The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, their first year of eligibility; the display describes them as &quot;Prime contenders, in the minds of many, for the title of World's Greatest Rock Band.&quot; Time magazine wrote in 1979 that &quot;No other group has ever pushed rock so far, or asked so much from it.&quot; Rolling Stone magazine wrote: &quot;Along with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, The Who complete the holy trinity of British rock.&quot; They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001, for creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording. In 2008 surviving members Townshend and Daltrey were honoured at the 31st Annual Kennedy Center Honors. That same year VH1 Rock Honors paid tribute to The Who where Jack Black of Tenacious D called them &quot;the greatest band of all time\n\n.: The Who Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img808.imageshack.us/img808/2155/thewho.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img808.imageshack.us/img808/2155/thewho.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1965 My Generation (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n1966 A Quick One (Japan box, 2 CD) @320\\CD1 Mono\n1966 A Quick One (Japan box, 2 CD) @320\\CD2 Stereo\n1967 The Who Sell Out (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n1969 Tommy (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n1971 Who's Next (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n1973 Quadrophenia (2 CD) @320\n1975 The Who By Numbers @320\n1978 Who Are You @320\n1981 Face Dances @320\n1982 It's Hard @320\n2006 Endless Wire (Wire &amp; Glass, Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\\CD1 (Wire &amp; Glass)\n2006 Endless Wire (Wire &amp; Glass, Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\\CD2 Live At Lyon\n\nLive albums\n1970 Live At Leeds (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n1970 Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970 (2 CD) @320\n1982 Live From Toronto (2 CD) @320\n1984 Who's Last @320\n1990 Join Together (2 CD) @320\n1993 Magic Bus (Live in Philadelphia) @320\n2000 BBC Sessions @320\n2000 The Who Live (The Blues To The Bush)(2 CD) @320\n2003 Live At The Royal Albert Hall (3 CD) @320\\CD1 2000-11-27\n2003 Live At The Royal Albert Hall (3 CD) @320\\CD2 2000-11-27\n2003 Live At The Royal Albert Hall (3 CD) @320\\CD3 bonus disc 2002-02-08\n2007 View From A Backstage Pass (2 CD) @320\n\nCompilations\n1968 Magic Bus - The Who On Tour @320\n1971 Meaty Beaty Big And Bouncy @320\n1974 Odds &amp; Sods @320\n1983 Rarities 1966-1972 Vols I &amp; II @320\n1985 Who's Missing @320\n1987 Two's Missing @320\n1988 Who's Better, Who's Best @320\n1994 Thirty Years Of Maximum R&amp;B (4 CD Box Set) @320\n1996 My Generation - The Very Best Of The Who @320\n1999 The Best Of The Who - The Millennium Collection @320\n2002 Ultimate Collection (2 CD) @320\n2004 Then and Now! @320\n\nSoundtracks\n1979 Quadrophenia (Original Sountrack) @320\n1979 The Kids Are Alright @320",
