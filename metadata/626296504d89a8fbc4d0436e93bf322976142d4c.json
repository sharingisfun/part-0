Not sure what it is, he takes it as a sign to get a head start on his resolutions: being a better son to his mother, whose birthday falls on New Year's Eve, being a better partner to his girlfriend, who he hasn't been completely honest with as of late, and being a better father to T, their beautiful 4 year old daughter. He starts out well, but as the day goes on, he realizes that change is not going to come easy. He crosses paths with friends, family, and strangers, each exchange showing us that there is much more to Oscar than meets the eye. But it would be his final encounter of the day, with police officers at the Fruitvale BART station that would shake the Bay Area to its very core, and cause the entire nation to be witnesses to the story of Oscar Grant.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/52b56520ebde0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/52b56520ebde0.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/52b5652114928.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/52b5652114928.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/52b565212ecd0.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/52b565212ecd0.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:626296504d89a8fbc4d0436e93bf322976142d4c","amp;dn":"Fruitvale+Station+%282013%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"626296504d89a8fbc4d0436e93bf322976142d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,98,150,80,77,137,168,251,196,208,67,110,147,191,50,41,118,20,45,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
