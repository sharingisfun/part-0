It will work on a properly cracked Skyrim game updated to version 1.8.151.0 (which is synonymous with RELOADED's update 11). It will also work with the bought version from Steam.\n\nThis is a 7-zip file properly compressed. To install, simply unzip Dragonborn.esm and Dragonborn.bsa into the Data directory of your Skyrim installation and check it in the Skyrim Launcher. Or, if you prefer, you may simply import it into your favorite mod manager (Nexus Mod Manager, for instance), and it will install it for you.\n\nAs always, if you like the game, BUY IT. Support good game developers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcda2a1da9981d2b313b7e1f2cc24b4b172120b7","amp;dn":"Skyrim.Dragonborn.DLC.%28bsa%2Besm%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcda2a1da9981d2b313b7e1f2cc24b4b172120b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,218,42,29,169,152,29,43,49,59,126,31,44,194,75,75,23,33,32,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
