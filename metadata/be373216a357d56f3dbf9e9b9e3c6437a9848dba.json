  "description": "FOCUS T25 ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA - X264 - MP4 - DVDRIP\n\nFully compatible with Softmodded Wii, Ipad, Iphone and many other devices that support x256 in MP4 container. Encoding was designed for maximum compatibility, good quality and high compression. Have Fun. Get Fit and SEED.\n\n25 Minutes. 5 Days a Week. 100% Results.\nThe only thing standing between you and the results you want is TIME. Shaun T experimented for the last year to design a program that delivers the same kind of results you'd expect from an hour-long program, in under 30 minutes. He's pulled out the rest to give you everything you need, nothing you don't. The result is FOCUS T25 and the name implies the intent: If you focus your intensity for 25 minutes, and you do it 5 days a week, you WILL get results.\n\nProduct Info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/focus-t25-workout.do&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/focus-t25-workout.do&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYour FOCUS T25 program includes:\n\nALPHA CYCLE WORKOUTS\n\nCARDIO\n25 minutes of calorie-burning, sweat-drenching cardio.\n\nSPEED 1.0\nIgnite your quickness.

If you want to enhance your balance, improve your stability, and crank up your fat-burning intensity, all you have to do is load up Core Speed and Push Play!
