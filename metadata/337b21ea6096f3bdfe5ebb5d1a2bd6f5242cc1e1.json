  "description": "RUDYARD KIPLING (1865-1936) was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist.  He was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration that characterize the creations of this world-famous author.&quot;\n\nKipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  His most enduring works of fiction include THE JUNGLE BOOK (1894), KIM (1901), and many short stories, including &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1888).  His poems include &quot;Mandalay&quot; (1890), &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1890), &quot;The Gods of the Copybook Headings&quot; (1919), &quot;The White Man's Burden&quot; (1899), and &quot;If--&quot; (1910).  He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story and his works for children have become classics of children's literature.\n\nHis subsequent reputation has changed according to the political and social climate of the age and the resulting contrasting views about him continued for much of the 20th century.  Henry James said: &quot;Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known.&quot;  On the other hand, George Orwell called him a &quot;prophet of British imperialism&quot;.  Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: &quot;[Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled.  But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced.  That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\n                                == COLLECTIONS ==\n\n* Complete Works of Rudyard Kipling (Delphi Classics, 2012)\n\n\n                            == NOVELS &amp; SHORT FICTION ==\n\n* Captains Courageous (Bantam Classics, 2006)\n\n* Captains Courageous (Penguin Classics, 2005).
