  "description": "For more information about this graphic novel, please see the wikilink here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Earth_One&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Earth_One&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBatman: Earth One is a one-shot, alternate reality take on the origins of the Dark Knight, written by the esteemed Geoff Johns with art by Gary Frank. This graphic novel re-imagines the story of Bruce Wayne from the ground up, with new and interesting takes on familiar characters such as Alfred and The Penguin and wholly original creations thrown into the mix as well. It is an easy read, especially for newcomers to the Caped Crusader, but veterans will find plenty to chew on as well.\n\nThis digital copy is by Minutemen-PhD. There was a previously digital release by Son of Ultron-Empire; however, despite being over 1 1/2 bigger in filesize (267 MB for that version, as opposed to 165 MB for this one), the resolution of this print is actually higher. Sample of page seven shows 1988x3056px for this copy vs. 1920x2951 for the SoU version. So, this is definitely the best one to grab IMO but then again, I'm biased! ;-)\nThanks as always to the scanner groups for their hard work, please seed and enjoy! :-)\n",
