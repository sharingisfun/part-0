I unpacked it all and re-uploaded without any zip files to make it easier for everyone.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\nIf you like these plugins then I urge you to support the developers and buy the product. Because demo and trial version suck, cracked plugins are a good way to try it before you buy it.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65af9c17a3a1bd8c2e7929092b6644f5461baad6","amp;dn":"SoundToys.Native.Effects.v4.1.1.AU.VST.RTAS.MAC.OSX-INTEL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65af9c17a3a1bd8c2e7929092b6644f5461baad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,175,156,23,163,161,189,140,46,121,41,9,43,102,68,245,70,27,170,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
