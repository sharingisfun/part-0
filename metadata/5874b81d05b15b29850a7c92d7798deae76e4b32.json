Growing up in working-class Boston, English discovers a medium for his talents the first time he sees a computer. As a young man, despite suffering from what would eventually be diagnosed as bipolar disorder, he begins his pilgrimâ€™s journey through the ups and downs in the brave new world of computers. Relating to the Internet as if itâ€™s an extension of his own mind, he discovers that he has a talent for conceiving innovative enterprises and building teams that can develop them, becoming â€œa Pied Piperâ€ of geeks. His innovative management style, success, and innate sense of fair play inspire intense loyalty. Early on, one colleague observes: â€œSomeday this boyâ€™s going to get hit by a truck full of money, and Iâ€™m going to be standing beside him.â€ Yet when English does indeed make a fortune, when the travel website Kayak is sold for almost two billion dollarsâ€”the first thing he thinks about is how to give the money away: â€œWhat else would you do with it?â€ The second thing he thinks is, Whatâ€™s next?\r\n\r\nWith the power of a consummate storyteller, Tracy Kidder casts a fresh, critical, and often humorous eye on the way new ideas and new money are reshaping our culture and the world. A Truck Full of Money is a mesmerizing portrait of an irresistibly endearing man who is indefatigable, original, and as unpredictable as America itself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5874b81d05b15b29850a7c92d7798deae76e4b32","amp;dn":"+A+Truck+Full+of+Money%3A+One+Man%27s+Quest+%282016%29+by+Tracy+Kidder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5874b81d05b15b29850a7c92d7798deae76e4b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,116,184,29,5,177,91,41,133,10,124,146,215,121,141,234,231,110,75,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
