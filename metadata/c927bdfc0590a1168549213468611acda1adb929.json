The book is written in a very conversational manner and most of the snippets are based on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s budding years and his experiences regarding money management.[/color][/size] \n\n[size=4][color=tomato]There were two main influences in Robert KiyosakiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. The first was his real father, an educator who worked hard for a fixed income all his life. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Ã¢â‚¬ËœPoor DadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The Rich Dad is his biological fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend. A real estate tycoon, he is portrayed as highly successful and assumes the tag of being the Ã¢â‚¬ËœRich DadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.[/color][/size]\n\n[size=4][color=turquoise]In the book, the author claims that his rich dad amassed wealth because he looked at income as a way to develop more wealth-creating assets. This attitude, the author states time and again, is the primary difference between the rich and the poor. His biological father on the other hand, spent his income on buying consumer goods that would give him and his family satisfaction. Kiyosaki singles this out as the reason why his Ã¢â‚¬ËœPoor DadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was never financially independent or secure.[/color][/size]\n\n[size=4][color=violet]Does hardwork really matter?\n\nOr is wealth just the by-product of making the right financial decisions?\n\nRobert Kiyosaki throws light on the above questions through a series of six easy to learn lessons. He constantly provides real life instances so that readers can relate to his lessons on buying income generating assets. Kiyosaki has written this book in collaboration with Sharon Lechter.\n\nRich Dad Poor Dad was number one on The New York Times paperback Ã¢â‚¬ËœadviceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ chart. It remained on this list for almost 100 weeks. Robert Kiyosaki wrote several other books after the success of Rich Dad Poor Dad and even released Rich Dad CDs.[/color][/size]\n\n[size=5][color=orangered][u][b]About the Author[/b][/u][/color][/size]\n\n[size=4][color=lightskyblue]Robert Kiyosaki is not just an author, he is also a game developer and real estate tycoon.\n\nSeveral of his books have been on the best seller list, and some of these include:\n\nIf You Want to be Rich and Happy, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Go To School\nCash Flow Quadrant\nRich DadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Investing\nWhy We Want You to be Rich: Two Men One Message\nRich DadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rich Brother Rich Sister\nThe author lives in Arizona with his wife Kim.
