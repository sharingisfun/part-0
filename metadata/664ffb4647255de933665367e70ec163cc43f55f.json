  "description": "Mysteries of the Ancient Past: A Graham Hancock Reader - Glenn Kreisberg et al [epub]\r\n\r\nAs we pull back the curtain from the European version of history, we discover the vast depth of knowledge of our ancient ancestors--knowledge that not only dispels our image of them as primitive peoples but also corresponds with the forefront of modern science, philosophy, and spirituality. \r\n\r\nWith contributions by David Frawley, Geoff Stray, Joscelyn Godwin, Daniel Pinchbeck, Antoine Gigal, and other provocative, cutting-edge thinkers, this collection of essays commissioned by Graham Hancock, bestselling author of Fingerprints of the Gods, represents the latest, often controversial findings in alternative science, history, archaeology, and consciousness research. Covering topics ranging from the origins of the Inca and the secrets hidden in Vedic literature, to the architecture of the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx, to unified theories of physics and consciousness, this book shows how, by recovering our lost history, we too can experience the higher consciousness and advanced wisdom of the ancients.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ With contributions by David Frawley, Geoff Stray, Joscelyn Godwin, Daniel Pinchbeck, Antoine Gigal, and others \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Topics range from the origins of the Inca to the architecture of the Giza plateau to unified theories of physics and consciousness \r\n\r\nâ€¢ Companion volume to Lost Knowledge of the Ancients",
