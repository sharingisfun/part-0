  "description": "[PC GAME] Age of Mythology The Titans Expansion\n\n[img]http://www.cashgenerator.co.uk/_images/product-details/TU351.jpg[/img]\n\nAge of Mythology:-\n\n The Titans adds a fourth mythology, the Atlanteans, to the existing Greek, Egyptian and Norse mythologies in Age of Mythology. A new single-player campaign will add yet another chapter to the expansive panoply of ancient folklore along with the addition of new scenarios. Atlantean players will be able to call upon the might of the Titan gods (such as Atlas and Cronus) multiple times throughout the game, and may also upgrade human units to heroes. The expansion pack will introduce 12 new god powers, 15 new human units and 12 formidable myth units to the game. \n\n\nAtlantean mythology:-\n\n Take advantage of unique cultural attributes, god powers, myth units and much more to dominate your opponents. Use your Titan god powers multiple times to demolish the opposition, promote selected units within the culture to hero status, and reap the benefits of a culture with new features, such as the ability to control time and space. Explore new maps and expand the &quot;playground of the gods.&quot; \n\nAn extended story line:-\n\n The Titans adds new scenarios to explore and conquer. In-game cinematics help to integrate and further enrich the gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story. \n\nA new victory condition:-\n\n Create a Titan unit that dwarfs everyone else; wreak havoc and rain destruction on enemy civilizations. \n\nAdditional powers, heroes and mythological units:-\n\n The Titans brings the ancient world to life in more detail than ever before with exciting gameplay elements and characters. The expansion pack will unveil the incredible powers of the Titan gods, which can be unleashed by the Atlanteans who worship them. In addition, new myth units and human units allow gamers to build their civilization and go into battle in a nearly infinite number of ways.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:-\n\nMinimum System Requirements:-\n\nSystem:Pentium 450 Mhz or Higher or equivalent\n RAM:512 MB\n Video Memory:32 MB\n Hard Drive Space:1GB.\n\nAge of Mythology: The Titans Tech Info:-\n\nPublisher:Microsoft Game Studios\n Developer:Ensemble Studios\n Genre:Real-Time Strategy\n Release Date: Sep 30, 2003 (US)\n ESRB:TEEN\n ESRB Descriptors:Blood, Violence\n\nGame Information:-\n\nConnectivity:Online, Local Area Network\n Online Modes:Competitive, Cooperative, Team Oriented\n Number of Players:1-12\n\nAge of Mythology: The Titans Hints &amp; Cheats:-\n\nCheat Codes \n\n While playing the game press enter and than input these codes.\n\n Cheat=Effect\n\n JUNK FOOD NIGHT=1000 food\n ATM OF EREBUS=1000 gold\n TROJAN HORSE FOR SALE=1000 wood\n L33T SUPA H4X0R=Buildings Build Much Faster\n MOUNT OLYMPUS=Gives you full favor\n LAY OF THE LAND=Reveals the map\n UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT=Hides the map\n THRILL OF VICTORY=Win the game\n CHANNEL SURFING=Skip to the next scenario in the campaign\n DIVINE INTERVENTION=Gives you all used god powers back\n PANDORAS BOX=Gives you four random god powers\n WRATH OF THE GODS=Gives you lightning storm, earthquake, meteor, and tornado god powers\n GOATUNHEIM=Gives you a god power that turns every unit on the map to goats\n FEAR THE FORAGE=Gives you a walking berry bushes power\n BAWK BAWK BOOM=Gives you a chicken meteor god power\n I WANT TEH MONKEYS!!!1!=Gives you alot of monkeys\n WUV WOO=Gives you a flying purple hippo\n TINES OF POWER=Gives you a forkboy\n O CANADA=Gives you a lazer bear\n ISIS HEAR MY PLEA=Gives you all heros from original AoM campaign\n CONSIDER THE INTERNET=Slows down units\n SET ASCENDANT=Reveals all the animals on the map\n IN DARKEST NIGHT=Makes game time night\n RED TIDE=Makes water red\n ATLANTIS REBORN=Gives Heroes From Expansion Campaign\n ZENOS PARADOX=Gives Random God Powers, Includes Atlantean\n RESET BUTTON=Unbuilds All Buildings On the Map\n TITANOMACHY=Provides An Instant Titan\n TINFOIL HAT=Randomizes the ownership of every unit on the map\n BARKBARKBARKBARKBARK =Gives you a dog.\n MR.
