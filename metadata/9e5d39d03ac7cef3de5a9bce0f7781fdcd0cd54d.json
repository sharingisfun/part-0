  "description": "Organic Chemistry (11th Ed)\nby T. W. Graham Solomons, Craig B. Fryhle and Scott A. Snyder\nWiley | January 2013 | ISBN-10: 1118133579 | PDF | 1248 pages | 130 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-T-Graham-Solomons/dp/1118133579&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-T-Graham-Solomons/dp/1118133579&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNow in a new edition, this book continues its tradition of excellence in teaching and preparing students for success in the organic classroom and beyond. A central theme of the authors' approach to organic chemistry is to emphasize the relationship between structure and reactivity. To accomplish this, the text is organized in a way that combines the most useful features of a functional group approach with one largely based on reaction mechanisms. Emphasizing mechanisms and their common aspects as often as possible, this book shows students what organic chemistry is, how it works, and what it does in living systems and the physical world around us.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\n1 The Basics Bonding and Molecular Structure 1\n2 Families of Carbon Compounds Functional Groups, Intermolecular Forces, and Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy 55\n3 Acids and Bases An Introduction to Organic Reactions and Their Mechanisms 104\n4 Nomenclature and Conformations of Alkanes and Cycloalkanes 142\n5 Stereochemistry Chiral Molecules 191\n6 Ionic Reactions Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination Reactions of Alkyl Halides 239\n7 Alkenes and Alkynes I Properties and Synthesis.
