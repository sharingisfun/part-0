Obviously a scripter forgot to re-activate the code and left the brackets in.\n\nAfter you're done the script should look like this:\nelseif event_message == 2 then\nscripting.ShowHUD(false)\nscripting.game_interface:stop_user_input(true)\nscripting.game_interface:add_time_trigger(&quot;shroud_3_HUD_gone&quot;, 1)\nscripting.game_interface:show_shroud(false)\nscripting.EnableFeature(&quot;list&quot;)\nscripting.HighlightComponent(&quot;button_lists&quot;, true)\n\nsave the file after doing this, and redo the last objective that should trigger Montreal and Quebec coming available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMinimum PC System Requirements:\n\nPC Processor Type\nIntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® processor, AMD processor\nPC Processor Speed\n2GHz\nPC Operating System\nWindows XP, Windows Vista\nPC System Memory\n512MB RAM\nPC Hard Drive Space\n10GB\n\nSOUND FIX INCLUDED!
