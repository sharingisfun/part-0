Charles Xavier and his X-Men try their best to deal with the Sentinels but they are able to adapt and deal with all mutant abilities. Charles decides to go back in time and change things. He asks Kitty Pryde who can send a person's consciousness into the person's past to send him but she can only send someone back a few weeks because if she sends someone back further it could harm them. So Logan decides to go back himself because he might be able to withstand it. So Charles tells him that it's Mystique who's responsible because when she learned about the Sentinels she sought out Bolivar Trask the man who created them and killed him. She would be caught and studied and her ability to change was somehow added to the Sentinels which is why they can adapt. Logan must go to the younger Charles and ask him to help; problem is...\n\nX-Men Days of Future Past: The Rogue Cut has intrigued us ever since it was announced that the bulk of Anna PaquinÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs sceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as Rogue had been unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical cut. One of the main reasons cited at the time was that the sub-plot which included her character made the film over-long, and interfered with the pace too much. Director Bryan Singer did promise however, that the scenes would be re-instated at a later date, and now we finally have access to them.\n\nThe new cut of the mutant movie features a whole seventeen minutes of additional footage which predominantly features Rogue. If you are one of the millions that has already seen the theatrical.\n\ncast\n\nHugh Jackman:...Logan / Wolverine\nJames McAvoy:...Charles Xavier\nMichael Fassbender:...Erik Lehnsherr\nJennifer Lawrence:...Raven / Mystique\nHalle Berry:...Storm\nNicholas Hoult:...Hank / Beast\nAnna Paquin:...Rogue\nEllen Page:...Kitty Pryde\nPeter Dinklage:...Dr. Bolivar Trask\n\n\n\nVideo:-\n\nFormat :mkv/AVC \nWriting Library :x264 /&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;88c0e1efe0c8c4bca6b8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nDuration : 2h 28mn 45s \nBitrate : 3 280 Kbps\nResolution=Width/Height : 1920 x 800 pixels \nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio:-\n\nFormat :AC-3 \nBitrate : 448 Kbps\nChannels :6 Channels\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE \nSample Rate : 48KHz\nLanguage : English\n\nRelease info:-\n\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \nTitle/Year : &quot;X-Men Days of Future Past 2014 The Rogue Cut&quot; / 2014\nFile Size : 3.95 GiB\nGenre :  Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi | Thriller \nSource :  BluRay REMUX-FraMeSToR [Thanks]\nChapters : Yes \nSample : Yes \nSubtitles(VobSub): English(SDH),Spanish,French.\nSubtitles(VobSub): English(SDH),GreekIndonesian,Indonesian,Arabic,Persian.\nSubtitles(VobSub): English(Forein parts) mix in mkv.\nIMDB :  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877832/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877832/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mRA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mRA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mRW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mRW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mRf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mRf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mm8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mm8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mma&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mmw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mmw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mm2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mm2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mmN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mmN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mmT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mmT&lt;/a&gt;\n\n        \n\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|3Li|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\n\n\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c06e8a71e4a0c1c78dc52d3e63ed4e9bb7f52c0a","amp;dn":"X-Men.Days.of.Future.Past.2014.The.Rogue.Cut.1080p.BluRay-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c06e8a71e4a0c1c78dc52d3e63ed4e9bb7f52c0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,110,138,113,228,160,193,199,141,197,45,62,99,237,78,155,183,245,44,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
