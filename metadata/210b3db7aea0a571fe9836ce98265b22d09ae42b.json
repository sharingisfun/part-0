  "description": "All episodes from all 7 seasons DVDRip + extras. Please seed at a decent speed.\n\n\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm is an American comedy television series produced and broadcast by HBO, which started its first season in 2000. To date, seven seasons comprising 70 episodes have aired, with an eighth season scheduled to air in 2011. The series was created by Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, who stars as a fictionalized version of himself. Curb follows David in his life as a semi-retired television writer and producer in Los Angeles. Cheryl Hines stars as David's wife Cheryl, Jeff Garlin as David's manager Jeff, and Susie Essman as Jeff's wife Susie. Curb Your Enthusiasm often features celebrities guest starring as themselves.\n\nThe plots and subplots of the episodes are established in an outline written by David and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors themselves. Plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas, and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, as well as his annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which leads him often into awkward situations.\n\nThe series was developed from a 1999 one-hour special titled Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, which David and HBO originally envisioned as a one-time project. This special was shot as a mockumentary, where the characters were aware of the presence of cameras and a crew. The series itself is not a mock documentary, but it is shot in a somewhat similar cinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ma vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-like style.\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm has been nominated for 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, and Robert B. Weide received an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. The show won the 2002 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Musical or Comedy.",
