Now including the Ruby high level programming language.

Shortcuts &amp; mouse actions now harmonize with FL StudioÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Piano roll and Playlist, where possible. Most exciting are the new Vibrato and Warp editors. The Vibrato editor allows users to create vibrato effects from scratch with controls including start/end amount and frequency. The editor even detects existing vibrato and displays this value so users can match the singers natural tendency, if desired. The Warp editor is designed to work with mono or polyphonic material and is perfect for slicing and re-timing/quantizing drum-loops, vocal performances and is great for sounddesign experimentation. Importantly, Newtone 2 is a free update for existing customers.\n- Harmor - Rising star of the Electro and Dubstep scene, voted in the top 10 plugins of 2013 by MusicRadar readers, now supports Komplexer WT wavetables &amp; 'Map audio regions to keys' for sampler like functionality and auto-dump to score for Slicex like drum handling. The preset count continues to rise too as patches keep flooding in from the thriving user base.\n- ZGameEditor Visualizer - Based on the free open source ZGameEditor that can be used to create 2D &amp; 3D video game style visualization objects for the plugin.

Under FL Studio 11 the plugin receives a slew of new shadier modules for stunning HD video effects.\n- DirectWave - Added multi-timbral mode to the FL native version so you can load and play more than one patch from note colors in the Piano roll.
