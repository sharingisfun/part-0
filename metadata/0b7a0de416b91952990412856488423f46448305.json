But some circumstances (ie, lack of adequate medication , then wait another &quot; final &quot; distribution , my personal problems ) prevented this . Nevertheless, I would cease to respect myself if deceived those who had been waiting for this release , who had hoped for me. And then, finally , he is before you . Please love and favor !\n\nAssembly includes 6 versions 6 and Russian versions Russian version for Windows 8.1 32 -bit (x86) and 64 -bit (x64) kernel :\n\n- Windows 8.1 Professional x86 Russian\n- Windows 8.1 Professional x86 English\n- Windows 8.1 Professional x64 Russian\n- Windows 8.1 Professional x64 English\n- Windows 8.1 Professional with WMC x86 Russian\n- Windows 8.1 Professional with WMC x86 English\n- Windows 8.1 Professional with WMC x64 Russian\n- Windows 8.1 Professional with WMC x64 English\n- Windows 8.1 Enterprise x86 Russian\n- Windows 8.1 Enterprise x86 English\n- Windows 8.1 Enterprise x64 Russian\n- Windows 8.1 Enterprise x64 English\n\nSome features of the assembly:\n\n- At the heart of the assembly are distributions Windows 8.1, posted on MSDN eighth day of April , 2014.\n- At the earliest stage of the installation has pre-load a menu where you can select the bit of the primary shell , that is what the installer is used , x86 or x64. Because of this, you should not worry that the 64- bit version of the OS can not stand up for RAID, and that users of 64-bit operating systems may be without service recovery system. For the most inquisitive : Do not attempt to install the 32 -bit version of the OS with the 64 -bit version - the final stage of deployment installer will throw an error and refuses to continue the installation .\n- Idle utility Windows Memory Diagnostic (Memtest), developers of affordable grace preboot menu is replaced by its working analogue distribution of Windows 7.\n- With the installation media folder removed  Sources  SXS, in which there were local files for manual install . NET Framework 3.5. But this does not mean that the package will be installed locally impossible. In the folder  Support  Framework_3.5 placed compact and easy -to-use installer . NET Framework 3.5 for Windows 8.1.\n- In the System Restore service that runs from the installation media , module is integrated Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (MSDaRT) 8.1, which greatly expands the possibilities of resuscitation system.\n- Fixed feature Installer Windows 8.1, when using the assembly file ei.cfg, useful for installation under UEFI-BIOS, it becomes impossible to run the installation from under an already installed system .\n- Fixed feature Installer Windows 8.1, when multilingual assembly when you run the installation from under an already installed system , there was no language selection Installer . In this assembly language interface is automatically determined based on what OS is running .\n- Since when it is started under an already installed system , the choice of wording installed in Windows 8.1 is carried out only by entering the serial number , right in the installer user interface built tips by serial number , which will help to implement this option.\n- With the Enterprise and Professional editions unfenced , because of which during the installation phase was impossible to enter the serial number .\n- After installation, you will be able to switch the interface language from English to Russian and back standard means Windows 8.1.\n- If during installation you will enter a valid license key the selected edition Windows 8.1 in the appropriate field , then the system will be activated by this switch to an entirely legitimate .\n- If during installation you will enter some dummy keys (see FAQ), then the system will be installed without any whatsoever activation. This can be useful if you later want to activate keys for Windows 8 ( for Professional and Enterprise) or Windows Media Center ( for Professional with WMC).\n- If during the installation under UEFI-BIOS you will enter the key at all, and when installing under an already installed system , take advantage of the key clues in the installer interface , the system will be activated automatically by the activator from KMSAuto Net 1.2.4 Ratiborus with the installation of automatic reactivation every 25 days.\n- If the system is activated automatically by a built- in assembly activator , in the start menu shortcut will be added to the executable file named activator &quot;KMS-activation&quot;. With this activator can be activated not only Windows, but Office 2010/2013 VL.\n- For technical reasons , the 64- bit edition OS with this assembly can not be updated for Windows 7/8.x.
