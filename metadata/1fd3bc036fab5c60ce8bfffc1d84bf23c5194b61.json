  "description": "I have found this from a chinese website but the game works perfectly well, as well as the dedicated server.\n\nFor those who have Version 9.3 and want to play online, you're welcome to join our server at:\n\n198.50.158.241 port 25000\n\nOpen 24/7, PVP Enabled with air drops and tons of zombies/wildlife.\n\nAlso on Teamspeak at the same IP address with default port.\n\nPLEASE Set your SteamAccountID as well as your username in the 3DMGAME.ini file (make sure you open the file as admin and it's not read only).\n\nCreate a new line below Username in order to add the SteamAcccountID (EXACTLY AS TYPED).\n\nPlease add a line below the username and type a number between 1 and 2^32-1 (4294967295) an example is below:\n\nUsername=CHANGEME\nSteamAcccountID=546541241\n\nMake it as hard to guess as possible, the harder it is the harder it will be for anyone to guess it and login as you (having your inventory and be in your location on the map).\n\nWe will be banning the default username and ID on our server located at 198.50.158.241 (Default port of 25000).
