  "description": "\nimage\nNothing More is an American heavy metal band from San Antonio, Texas. Signed to Eleven Seven Music Group,the ensemble has released six studio albums to date, including their self-titled album released in 2014. The lead single off their self-titled major label debut, entitled &quot;This is the Time (Ballast)&quot; hit number 1 on the Mediabase Active Rock chart and number 2 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nIf there are two words that best describe Nothing More, they are innovation and evolution. There is no better example of this than Nothing MoreÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s newly released fourth album (self titled) and the dynamic show they are building around it. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve set the highest bar possible for the album and vow to eclipse that, at every outing with the live show.\n\nFrom their humble beginnings in Texas, Nothing More answered the call to serve in the militia of independent touring artists. Armed with the idea that it takes brains and balls to create your destiny in this world, these young men climbed aboard a vintage RV, salvaged from a Ã¯Â¬ï¿½eld and set sail. Now, a few short years later and with three full-length albums and over 500 live shows under their belts, they have mastered the DIY philosophy in every imaginable way, all the while never forgetting to put their fans Ã¯Â¬ï¿½rst.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Before we had even started touring we knew that we wanted to do more than just play our songs. We wanted to entertain and really connect with people in a unique way.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jonny Hawkins\n\nNothing More donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take the stage, they storm it. Alternating between enormous rock anthems full of technical precision and four man percussion assaults that have more in common with the Blue Man Group, than a rock show. There is nothing pedestrian about this band. Welded from discarded truck and motorcycle parts, singer Jonny HawkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ percussion platform serves as a de-facto drum kit for Hawkins to accentuate and expertly pound rhythms in tandem with world-class drummer Paul OÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Brien. From the gut wrenching, yet sonically distinct riffs of guitar virtuoso, Mark Vollelunga, to the thundering yet melodic bass of Daniel Oliver or HawkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ commanding presence and charismatic delivery of sing-along lyrics too impossible to ignore; Nothing More is a Ã¯Â¬ï¿½erce, snarling juggernaut poised to take the World by storm. Nothing MoreÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“take no prisonersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ approach holds anyone within eyeshot or earshot hostage until the very last note.\n\nWith the newly released, self-titled album, Nothing More feels they have truly hit a zenith of creativity. This record is artistically landscaped and woven together poetically with vast, dynamic musicality; and at the same time brutally honest in its lyrics and poignant in its delivery. It speaks softly of the beauty of personal and outward forgiveness amidst heartbreak through the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Be OKÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, then takes you into the hell of being cheated on by graphically depicting scenes of inÃ¯Â¬ï¿½delity in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex and LiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nimage\nNothing More At MySpace\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Nothing More\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
