Whether to save studio and editing time, ease the frustration of endless retakes, save that otherwise once-in-a-lifetime performance, or create the Auto-Tune Vocal Effect (the Cher/T-Pain effect), Auto-Tune is the overwhelming tool of choice.\n\nWhat's New in Auto-Tune 7\n\nBy far the most dramatic addition to Auto-Tune 7 is its entirely new time correction and manipulation system. Seamlessly integrated into the Graphical Mode interface, Auto-Tune 7's time control capabilities allow you to quickly and easily edit the timing of your vocals right along with their pitch.\n\nAuto-Tune 7 also features the second generation of Antares' EvoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Voice Processing Technology, offering even more natural pitch shifting and throat modeling, along with a host of time-saving workflow enhancements.\n\nMedicine &amp; installation instruction included  \n\n\n\n    ______)          _____                        ______         \n   (, /  /)         (, /   ) ,                   (, /    )       \n     /  (/    _      _/__ /    __  _  _/_  _       /---(  _      \n  ) /   / )__(/_     /     _(_/ (_(_(_(___(/_   ) / ____)(_(_(_/_\n (_/              ) /                          (_/ (        .-/  ( DeGun 2011\n                 (_/                                       (_/   \t\t\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; Http://ThePirateBay.org/user/DeGun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; Http://ThePirateBay.org/user/DeGun&lt;/a&gt;\t",
