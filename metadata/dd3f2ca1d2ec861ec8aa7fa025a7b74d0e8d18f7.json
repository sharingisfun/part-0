  "description": "WHEN HARRY MET SALLY - 1989\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.7 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  The first time Harry met Sally there was tension and they parted with a slight animosity. The second time Harry met Sally he didn&amp;#039;t remember her. The third time Harry met Sally he not only remembered her, but the two struck up a friendship that would carry them through some ups and downs.\n  Harry is determined that men and women could never be friends because the sensual tension would always get in the way. This prevents him from staying in touch with Sally but over the years, as Harry goes through a divorce and Sally goes through a bad breakup, the two reconnect and form a bond that proves stronger than any relationship they&amp;#039;ve ever had before. Their best friends Marie and Jess, who just so happen to have fallen in love and gotten married themselves, try to push the two of them together, since they feel as though they belong together, but Harry and Sally don&amp;#039;t want to ruin the great friendship they have achieved.\n\n  Starring: Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal, Carrie Fisher, Bruno Kirby. \n\n  Directed by: Rob Reiner.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 35min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 400\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps",
