Other new moves include the ability to retain control of\nthe ball when sliding in to tackle, while all-new feints and backwards\ndribbling are now available thanks to the improved dribbling controls,\nwhile headers have been changed to allow players more movement in the way\ntheir strikers jump and head the ball.\nPro Evolution Soccer 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for\ninclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits\nfor Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Details on\nofficial club teams and more national squads will follow.\nOther new additions include more balanced referees, and a selection of\nexciting new gameplay modes.
