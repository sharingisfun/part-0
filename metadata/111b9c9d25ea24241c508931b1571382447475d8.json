Or touring Europe in a punk cabaret band and finding a place to sleep each night by reaching out to strangers on Twitter. For Amanda Palmer, actions like these have gone beyond satisfying her basic needs for food and shelter - they've taught her how to turn strangers into friends, build communities, and discover her own giving impulses. And because she had learned how to ask, she was able to go to the world to ask for the money to make a new album and tour with it, and to raise over a million dollars in a month.\n\nIn The Art of Asking, Palmer expands upon her popular TED talk to reveal how ordinary people, those of us without thousands of Twitter followers and adoring fans, can use these same principles in our own lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111b9c9d25ea24241c508931b1571382447475d8","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Asking+-+Amanda+Palmer+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111b9c9d25ea24241c508931b1571382447475d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,27,156,157,37,234,36,36,28,80,137,49,177,87,19,130,68,116,117,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
