  "description": "Tears For Fears\nTears Roll Down\nGreatest Hits '82-'92 (1991)\n\nTears for Fears were always more ambitious than the average synth pop group. From the beginning, the duo of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith were tackling big subjects -- their very name derived from Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy, and his theories were evident throughout their debut, The Hurting. Driven by catchy, infectious synth pop, The Hurting became a big hit in their native England, setting the stage for international stardom with their second album, 1985's Songs From the Big Chair. On the strength of the singles &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; and &quot;Shout,&quot; the record became a major hit, establishing the duo as one of the leading acts of the second generation of MTV stars. Instead of quickly recording a follow-up, Tears for Fears labored over their third album, the psychedelic and jazz-rock-tinged The Seeds of Love. While the album was a big hit, it was the end of an era instead of a new beginning. Smith left the group early in the '90s, and Orzabal continued with Tears for Fears, pursuing more sophisticated and pretentious directions to a smaller audience.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Sowing The Seeds Of Love\n02.Everybody Wants To Rule The World\n03.Woman In Chains\n04.Shout\n05.Head Over Heels\n06.Mad World\n07.Pale Shelter\n08.I Believe\n09.Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)\n10.Mothers Talk\n11.Change\n12.Advice For The Young At Heart\n",
