  "description": "By Anthony Rupert\n\nMost times when an artist releases a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation, people beef over which songs should have or shouldn't have been on there. I've seen reviews where people give a collection one star just because THAT song wasn't on there. But this 17-song collection is a pretty accurate representation of Keith Sweat's career.\n\nI noticed that a lot of the songs are from his first album Make It Last Forever. Sure, that was his best album, but maybe he should've included a good number of songs from ALL of the albums. Oh well, there are other hits you remember, like &quot;Nobody&quot;, &quot;Twisted&quot;, &quot;I'll Give All My Love To You&quot;, and even LSG's &quot;My Body&quot;. And most hits collections contain a hard-to-find song, and here there's &quot;(There You Go) Tellin' Me No Again&quot; (from the New Jack City soundtrack).\n\nI'm not exactly sure why the Snoop Dogg-assisted &quot;Come And Get With Me&quot; is on here, but regardless, this is still a good album to buy if all your Keith Sweat cassettes are worn out or lost.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeith Sweat - The Best of Keith Sweat: Make You Sweat\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Keith Sweat\nAlbum................: The Best of Keith Sweat: Make You Sweat\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2004\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 271kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
