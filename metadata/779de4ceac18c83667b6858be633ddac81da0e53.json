The London Philharmonic complement Itzhak Perlman splendidly.\n\nEverybody knows &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;. Spring is one of the best known classical pieces of all times. Perlman&amp;#039;s playing is lovely and the music is superb and famous for a reason, but it is my personal opinion that what is truly wonderful here is the small selection of violin concertos.\n\nThese concertos are rather well known to those who are knowledgable in classical music or play an instrument (violin, in this case). To the rest of the world they are much less known, and that is a pity. These are wonderful pieces of music, played incredibly with great sound.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Violin Concerto, for violin, strings &amp; continuo in E major (&quot;La Primavera,&quot; The Four Seasons; &quot;Il cimento&quot; No. 1), Op.8/1, RV 269\nComposed by Antonio Vivaldi\nPerformed by London Philharmonic Orchestra\nConducted by Itzhak Perlman\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Violin Concerto, for violin, strings &amp; continuo in G minor (&quot;L&amp;#039;estate,&quot; The Four Seasons; &quot;Il cimento&quot; No. 2), Op. 8/2, RV 315\nComposed by Antonio Vivaldi\nPerformed by London Philharmonic Orchestra\nConducted by Itzhak Perlman\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Violin Concerto, for violin, strings &amp; continuo in F major (&quot;L&amp;#039;autunno,&quot; The Four Seasons; &quot;Il cimento&quot; No. 3), Op.8/3, RV 293\nComposed by Antonio Vivaldi\nPerformed by London Philharmonic Orchestra\nConducted by Itzhak Perlman\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Violin Concerto, for violin, strings &amp; continuo in F minor (&quot;L&amp;#039;inverno,&quot; The Four Seasons; &quot;Il cimento&quot; No. 4), Op. 8/4, RV 297\nComposed by Antonio Vivaldi\nPerformed by London Philharmonic Orchestra\nConducted by Itzhak Perlman\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Violin Concerto, for violin, strings &amp; continuo in C minor (&quot;Il sospetto&quot;), RV 199\nComposed by Antonio Vivaldi\nPerformed by Israel Philharmonic Orchestra\nConducted by Itzhak Perlman\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Violin Concerto, for violin, strings &amp; continuo in A minor (&quot;L&amp;#039;estro armonico&quot; No. 6), Op. 3/6, RV 356\nComposed by Antonio Vivaldi\nPerformed by Israel Philharmonic Orchestra\nConducted by Itzhak Perlman\n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Violin Concerto, for violin, strings &amp; continuo in A major (&quot;La stravaganza&quot; No. 5) Op. 4/5, RV 347\nComposed by Antonio Vivaldi\nPerformed by Israel Philharmonic Orchestra\nConducted by Itzhak Perlman\n\n\nLabel: EMI Classics\nDate: August 13, 2002\n\nBITRATE: 320\n\nMy cd-rip (EAC and Lame)\nCovers Included\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy,Seed and Share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:779de4ceac18c83667b6858be633ddac81da0e53","amp;dn":"Antonio+Vivaldi-The+Four+Seasons+and+Violin+Concertos+%28Itzhak+Pe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"779de4ceac18c83667b6858be633ddac81da0e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,157,228,206,172,24,200,54,103,182,133,139,230,51,221,172,129,218,14,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
