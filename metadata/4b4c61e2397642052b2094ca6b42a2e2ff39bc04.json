  "description": "JASON ALDEAN has the number one country song for 2014 with When She Says Baby. The year-end chart includes all singles from Nov 10, 2013 to Nov 08, 2014 and ranked by Mediabase. LUKE BRYAN, however, was the most played artist (no surprise considering he had 4 entries last year), followed by BLAKE SHELTON at number 2 and then FLORIDA-GEORGIA LINE in the third position.\n\nFor archiving purposes I have deleted the position number of each song and listed them alphabetically by artist/group.
