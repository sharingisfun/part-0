The GRE math section is not easy. There is no quick fix that will allow you to &quot;beat&quot; the section. But GRE math is very learnable. If you study hard and master the techniques in this book, your math score will improve--significantly! The GRE cannot be &quot;beaten.&quot; But it can be mastered--through hard work, analytical thought, and by training yourself to think like a test writer. Many of the problems in this book are designed to prompt you to think like a test writer. For example, you will find &quot;Duals.&quot; These are pairs of similar problems in which only one property is different. They illustrate the process of creating GRE questions. * If your target is a 700+ score, this is the book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7595e00608d930f62b0508d83d7ad65d48083606","amp;dn":"GRE+Math+Tests-Nova+%282014%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7595e00608d930f62b0508d83d7ad65d48083606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,149,224,6,8,217,48,246,43,5,8,216,61,122,214,93,72,8,54,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
