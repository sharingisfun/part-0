  "description": "Assassins Creed II-SKIDROW\n\nRELEASE DATE : 21-04-2010 PROTECTION : Ubisoft DRM\n GAME TYPE: Action DISKS: 1 DVD\n\n Release Notes: ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œ\n\n While we worked on this release, we noticed that several news \nwebpages, forums, blogs etc. posted information, including a\nscreenshot of a Ubisoft server attack message, which showed \nour group name. \n\nFirst of all, that picture is a fake, nor would any member of \nSkid Row cause such riot, as we're only here to compete with\nour game release competitors, nothing else. \n\nNeither do we encourage anyone to take such actions, no matter\nhow much we agree, that DRM's like this one, are only hurting \nthose that do want to buy the game or have bought it. \n\nAnother point is those news medias, we mentioned before, post \nanything these days, no matter if it's a joke or not. Beware\nwhat you're posting, just because you want to prank someone.\n\nThis release is an accomplishment of weeks of investigating,\nexperimenting, testing and lots of hard work. \n\nWe know that there is a server emulator out in the open, which\nmakes the game playable, but when you look at our cracked \ncontent, you will know that it can't be compared to that. \n\nOur work does not construct any program deviation or any kind \nof host file paradox solutions. Install game and copy the \ncracked content, it's that simple.\n\nSince we don't want to see cheap imitations, we protected our \nwork with a solid shield. Not because we want to deceive the\nmajority, like certain people out there, but because we have\nin the past been an open book of knowledge for our competitors. \n\nReal cracking is done by The Leading Force! \n\nOn with the game release information: \n\nAssassin's CreedÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 2 is the follow-up to the title that became \nthe fastest-selling new IP in video game history. The highly\nanticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da \nFirenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the\nRenaissance.\n\nAssassin's Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that\nmade the first opus a resounding success and features new \nexperiences that will surprise and challenge players. \n\nAssassin's Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and\nconspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a \nRenaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on \nFlorence's most powerful families and ventures throughout the \ncanals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin. \n\nEZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA Ezio Auditore da Firenze is\na young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins\nafter his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. \nHe is a lady's man, a free soul with panache yet has a very \nhuman side to his personality. Through him, you become a\nmaster assassin.\n\nRENAISSANCE ITALY Italy in the 15th century was less a country\nand more a collection of city-states where families with\npolitical and economic strength began to take leadership roles\nin cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some \nof the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a\ntime in history where culture and art were born alongside some\nof the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder. \n\nA NEW-FOUND FREEDOM You will be able to perform missions when \nyou want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings\nback free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even \nflying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another \nlayer for you to truly play through the game any way you\nchoose. \n\nDYNAMIC CROWD Discover a living, breathing world where every\ncharacter is an opportunity for the player. Blending in with\nthe crowd is easier, working with in-game characters provide\nample rewards but can also lead to surprising consequences. \n\nBECOME A MASTER ASSASSIN Perfect your skills to become a\nmaster assassin where you brandish new weapons, learn to\ndisarm enemies then use their weapons against them, and \nassassinate enemies using both hidden blades. \n \n 1. Mount image or burn it \n 2. Install\n 3. Run the v1.01 update exe from UPDATE folder on the DVD or\n let the game auto update by itself \n 4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to \n these locations and overwrite. 32 bit is for both XP, Vista\n and Win7 editions. 64 bit for Vista and Win7 locations.\n\n 32 bit version:\n\n C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher folder \n\n 64 bit version:\n\n C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher folder \n\n 5. Play the game\n\nSpecial Notes:\n\nThank you Ubisoft, this was quiete a challenge for us, but\nnothing stops the leading force from doing what we do. Next \ntime focus on the game and not on the DRM. It was probably\nhorrible for all legit users. We just make their lifes easier.\n\nSpecial greetz to our friends in GENESIS, you guys are amongst\nthe very few who still manage to do this with the scene spirit\nintact. Well done guys! \n\nSupport the companies, which software you actually enjoy!\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13621.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13621.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13622.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13622.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13623.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13623.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13624.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/image/14000/13624.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAssassins Creed II-SKIDROW Torrent Free Download\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7&lt;/a&gt;",
