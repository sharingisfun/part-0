Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f9863b9104ffea0139e7f8f33de1821b536f8a8","amp;dn":"The+Tipping+Point+Malcolm+Gladwell+-+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f9863b9104ffea0139e7f8f33de1821b536f8a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,152,99,185,16,79,254,160,19,158,127,143,51,222,24,33,181,54,248,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
