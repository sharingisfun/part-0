Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged by the life they've eked out together and by the experiences they've had leading into their marriage. Dean, a high school drop out, comes from a broken home, where he never really had a mother figure. He never saw himself getting married or having a family despite falling in love at first sight with Cindy. He doesn't have any professional ambition beyond his current work - which he enjoys since he feels he can knock off a beer at 8 o'clock in the morning without it affecting his work - although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an example of a harmonious married or family life...\n\n\nScreenshots:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.min.us/inruRM.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.min.us/inruRM.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.min.us/inqVso.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.min.us/inqVso.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.min.us/inrsJE.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.min.us/inrsJE.png&lt;/a&gt;",
