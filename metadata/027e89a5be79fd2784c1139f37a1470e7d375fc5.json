I swept the usenets uncriticvally for every ebook I could find relating to the subject, weeded out the dupes and fakes, and wrapped it up. I haven't read even a percentage of it yet, so don't blame me if some of it's crap. I have skimmed quite a few of them, and there are great lessons to be had even for advanced academics; read Schoenberg's Fundamentals only if you are in a daring mood. However the complete basics are covered as well: both dummies' and complete idiots' guides are included. There are some great listening excersises for both singers and guitarists and even thought I havent been labelling the books by difficulty, it sohuld be the simplest task to read them progreessively judging merely by the titles. I will however recommend Harnum's 'Basic Music Theory' as a starting point for anyone who is already aquainted with an instrument.\n\nSee : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebin.com/2LGrNGL9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebin.com/2LGrNGL9&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:027e89a5be79fd2784c1139f37a1470e7d375fc5","amp;dn":"Music+Theory+-+eBook+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"027e89a5be79fd2784c1139f37a1470e7d375fc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,126,137,165,190,121,253,39,132,193,19,159,55,161,71,14,125,55,95,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
