It was recorded in Northern Italy, produced by the band themselves and mixed by Mark ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SpikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Stent. In terms of sound and sonic vision The Resistance is their most ambitious long-player yet, which is clearly saying something. They have blown up the robo-funk/monster riff/stadium space rock sound of Black Holes... and widened their viewfinder even further to take in an even greater horizon of sound. \n \n\n",
