First was the easy summertime groove of &quot;You,&quot; followed by &quot;Promise,&quot; a shimmering duet with Usher. Both tracks hit the top spot on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs and Tropical Songs charts. On Ã¢â‚¬Å“Formula, Vol. 1Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Santos offers proof that the singles were merely teasers. Kept mainly to slow to mid-tempo ballads, Santos crosses bachata, nuevo flamenco, and merengue, melded with just enough contemporary R&amp;B, to create an intoxicating brew.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“FÃƒÂ³rmula, Vol. 2Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2014) has benefited enormously from three straight number one pre-release singles on the Latin Airplay chart. Santos doesn't deviate much from the new bachata style that established him, though he does extend it considerably when he involves other guests. Santos' songwriting, the production, and the inspired performances offer a portrait of modern pop bachata at its very best. Santos proved himself an up-and-comer on Vol. 1, but on Vol. 2 he not only delivers on the promise, but emerges as a fully formed innovator.\n\n\n\nRomeo Santos\n\nCD 1: FÃƒÂ³rmula, Vol. 1 (2011)\n\nCD 2: FÃƒÂ³rmula, Vol. 2 (2014)\n\n\n\n  2CDs / 2011, 2014 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1 / Formula, Vol.1:\n\n01.
