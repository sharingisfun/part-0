Despite the name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes in an interview with a Polish rock magazine Teraz Rock told the story of the band&amp;#039;s name. He said that his friend, Lou, was trying to make Josh Homme like death metal. When he played Vader, Homme called them &quot;The Eagles of death metal.&quot; Later, Josh Homme inspired him to write music that he thought would be The Eagles crossed with death metal, and their debut album was the result. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of &quot;bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.&quot; Jesse Hughes is known and somewhat loved by fans for his over-enthusiastic and charismatic interaction with audiences at live performances.\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Eagles of Death Metal       \nAlbum     -  various                                          \nGenre     -  rock                                             \nLabel     -  Rekords Rekords, Downtown Records, Gun Records\nYear      -  1998 - present                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  207.44 MB\nkbps      -  VBR / 192 or higher\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
