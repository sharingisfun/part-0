Cornell is also known for his role as one of the architects of the '90s grunge movement, for his extensive catalog as a songwriter and for his near 4 octave vocal range as well as his powerful vocal belting technique. \n\nHe has released three solo studio albums, Euphoria Morning (1999), Carry On (2007), Scream (2009), and live album Songbook (2011). Cornell received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his song &quot;The Keeper&quot; which appeared in the film Machine Gun Preacher and co-wrote and performed the theme song to the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006), &quot;You Know My Name&quot;.

The album is scheduled to be released on September 18, 2015.\n\nRecording\n\n\nCornell chose producer Brendan O'Brien as a collaborator to create a more intimate sound for the record. On recording drums for the album, Cornell has stated that &quot;most of the songs with drums are either loops that I made electronically or that Brendan basically recorded just playing a little drum kit he had,&quot; Cornell says. &quot;We just made loops, layered things and played some percussion stuff.&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart&quot;   \t  \t3:54\n2. \t&quot;Dead Wishes&quot;   \t  \t4:55\n3. \t&quot;Worried Moon&quot;   \t  \t4:32\n4. \t&quot;Before We Disappear&quot;   \t  \t3:51\n5. \t&quot;Through the Window&quot;   \t  \t4:41\n6. \t&quot;Josephine&quot;   \t  \t3:38\n7. \t&quot;Murder of Blue Skies&quot;   \t  \t3:42\n8. \t&quot;Higher Truth&quot;   \t  \t5:06\n9. \t&quot;Let Your Eyes Wander&quot;   \t  \t3:42\n10. \t&quot;Only These Words&quot;   \t  \t3:29\n11. \t&quot;Circling&quot;   \t  \t3:28\n12. \t&quot;Our Time in the Universe&quot;   \t  \t4:19\n13. \t&quot;Bend in the Road&quot;   \t  \t3:37\n14. \t&quot;Wrong Side&quot;   \t  \t5:13\n15. \t&quot;Misery Chain&quot;   \t  \t4:42","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979efbbb14407bb79b35e945ef10e74493ae6bb6","amp;dn":"Chris+Cornell+-+Higher+Truth++2015+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979efbbb14407bb79b35e945ef10e74493ae6bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,158,251,187,20,64,123,183,155,53,233,69,239,16,231,68,147,174,107,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
