  "description": "Artist: The Handsome Family\nRelease: Singing Bones\nReleased: 2007\nLabel: Loose Music\nCatalog#: VJCD 144\nFormat: FLAC / Lossless / Log (100%) / Cue\nCountry: USA\nStyle: folk\n\nimage\n\n\n1.\tThe Forgotten Lake (3:47)\n2.\tGail With the Golden Hair (3:16)\n3.\t24-Hour Store (4:53)\n4.\tThe Bottomless Hole (3:16)\n5.\tFar From Any Road (2:48)\n6.\tIf the World Should End in Fire (1:09)\n7.\tA Shadow Underneath (3:44)\n8.\tDry Bones (3:16)\n9.\tFallen Peaches (2:59)\n10.\tWhitehaven (2:46)\n11.\tSleepy (3:08)\n12.\tThe Song of a Hundred Toads (2:29)\n13.\tIf the World Should End in Ice (1:08)\n\n\n\nThe Handsome Family's unique take on traditionalist country finds another fine platform on 2003's SINGING BONES. Husband and wife team Brett and Rennie Sparks explore dusty, melancholic territory--both musically and lyrically--by combining a taste for rootsy, old-school country (for which Brett's resonant baritone is perfectly suited) with literate, evocative, image-rich lyrics.\nSINGING BONES finds all these qualities in place. Scenes and characters float through vividly drawn settings (&quot;24-Hour Store;&quot; &quot;Whitehaven&quot;), while the instrumentation, arrangements, and ambience conjure dark forests and backwoods ghosts. As old-world as the Handsome Family might seem, there is an incisive contemporary sensibility to everything from the gleaming production to the perfectly chosen words. SINGING BONES proves again how the group can stitch the gap between present and past seamlessly...\n",
