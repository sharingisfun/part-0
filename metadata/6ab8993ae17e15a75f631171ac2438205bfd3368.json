  "description": "&quot;Black Mirror&quot; is an award-winning British television drama series created by Charlie Brooker and shows the dark side of life and technology. The series is produced by Zeppotron for Endemol, and shown on Channel 4.\n\nRegarding the programme's content and structure, Brooker noted, &quot;each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. But they're all about the way we live now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.&quot;\n\nA press release describes the series as &quot;a hybrid of The Twilight Zone and Tales of the Unexpected which taps into our contemporary unease about our modern world&quot;, with the stories having a &quot;techno-paranoia&quot; feel. Channel 4 describes the first episode as &quot;a twisted parable for the Twitter age&quot;.\n\n\nThese are the scene HDTV 720p rips of series 1 and 2, with added soft subtitles downloaded from addic7ed.com.\n\nFILENAMES:\nBlack.Mirror.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA.mkv\nBlack.Mirror.S01E02.720p.HDTV.x264-TLA.mkv\nBlack.Mirror.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264-TLA.mkv\nBlack.Mirror.S02E01.720p.HDTV.x264-FoV.mkv\nBlack.Mirror.S02E02.720p.HDTV.x264-FoV.mkv\nBlack.Mirror.S02E03.720p.HDTV.x264-FoV.mkv",
