  "description": "\nGeorge Orwell - Complete Collection (eBooks + Audio Books + Other Work){Abee}\n______________________________\n\nOrwell was a Indo-British journalist and author, who wrote two of the most famous novels of the 20th century 'Animal Farm' and 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in eastern India, the son of a British colonial civil servant. He was educated in England and, after he left Eton, joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer. In 1928, he moved to Paris where lack of success as a writer forced him into a series of menial jobs.\n\n             ***************************************************************\n            | In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act. |\n             ***************************************************************\n\n As, Orwell said once, his work reflects his thoughts of political criticism(&amp; satire) very reactionary &amp; revolutionary. So, This is my tribute to him.\n\n\nTORRENT COVER:\n\n____________________________________________________________\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/abee5/8500013978/in/photostream&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/abee5/8500013978/in/photostream&lt;/a&gt;\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\nTORRENT DESCRIPTION:\n\n\nAudio books: (All are of high quality, unabridged &amp; self Checked)\n______\n\n1984 @ 80kbps\n\nAnimal Farm @ 256kbps\n\nHomage to Catalonia @ 80kbps\n\nDown and Out In Paris and London @ 90kbps\n\nA Clergyman's Daughter(BBC) @ 128kbps\n\n*Actually, Other audio books, Either I couldn't find or they were in very poor quality which ceased me to add.
