  "description": "\nUltimate Guide to Raspberry Pi - 2014  UK\n\n164 Pages | True PDF | English | 10 MB \n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi for Beginners will help get you started as a coder by encouraging you to create your own programs and make the most out of your revolutionary Ã‚Â£30 PC. (Our advice applies to Windows users too.) We cover the theory you must know and then put those concepts to work in building two games Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one simple and one more complex. Games are great because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fun and they include all the ingredients common to most coding projects, from software utilities to robotic control. They can also lead to a great career as a games programmer. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also show you how to create an independent weather station that can be sited anywhere that has power and Wi-Fi. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s get started and fasten your seatbelt as we welcome you to the world of coders, tinkerers, makers and rocket scientists. \n",
