  "description": "Working and Tested (on Windows XP, 7, and 8.1) Quickbooks Point of Sale v11 2013 Multistore or Basic\n\nInstructions mainly by dechronic, with quite a few edits and changes by me.\n\nThis activation patch was made possible because of the information \nprovided by means of Beast_iND's activator/patcher and based on the\ninformation provided by microbolt.\n\nAll thanks therefore go to them.\n\nThis patch should only be a temporary solution until Beast_iND\nreleases a newer version of his patcher that includes support for\nQuickbooks 2013, I personally still prefer his patcher, as his patcher\nis comprehensive, as it also supports older versions of Quickbooks.\n\ndechronic\n\nChanges since the previous versions:\n\nv0.14 (Working)\nVersions 0.12 and 0.13 are just not working.\nI have just lightened up the code, since the way Windows repairs itself, the program I use to close any open programs should always be present. I therefore took out  the checks for that file, which were causing problems.\nI need to learn a language that can be compiled. \n",
