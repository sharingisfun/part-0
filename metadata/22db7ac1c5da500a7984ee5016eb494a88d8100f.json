All of the compositions were written by Coltrane, save one (&quot;I&amp;#039;m Old Fashioned&quot;, a Jerome Kern/Johnny Mercer standard). The title track is a long, rhythmically variegated blues with a brooding minor theme that gradually shifts to major during Coltrane&amp;#039;s first chorus. &quot;Locomotion&quot; is also a blues riff tune. Elsewhere, whereas Coltrane&amp;#039;s next major LP, Giant Steps, would break new melodic and harmonic ground in jazz, Blue Train adheres to the hard bop style of the era. That being said, two of its tunes, &quot;Moment&amp;#039;s Notice&quot; and &quot;Lazy Bird&quot; do anticipate the &quot;Coltrane changes&quot; he would later develop. (Musicologist Lewis Porter has also demonstrated a harmonic relationship between Coltrane&amp;#039;s &quot;Lazy Bird&quot; and Tadd Dameron&amp;#039;s &quot;Lady Bird&quot;.\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane - Tenor saxophone\nLee Morgan - Trumpet\nCurtis Fuller - Trombone\nPaul Chambers - Bass\nKenny Drew - Piano\nPhilly Joe Jones - Drums\n\nRecorded on September 15, 1957.\n\nTrack listing:\n1.
