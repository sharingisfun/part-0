A lot of the songs were \nactually written while we were there in the studio \nand we rehearsed and recorded them straight away while \nthey were still fresh, and I think that immediacy really \nshows in the songs, they have almost a live feel to them, I think. \nI'm very proud of The Book Of Souls, we all are, \nand we can't wait for our fans to hear it, \nand especially to take it out on the road next year!&quot;\n\nBruce Tells\n\n&quot;We're really excited about The Book Of Souls and \nhad a fantastic time creating it. We started working on the album\nin late summer 2014 and recorded it at Guillame\nTell Studios in Paris, where we'd done the Brave New World \nalbum back in 2000 so the studio holds special memories for all of us. \nWe were delighted to discover the same magical vibe is still\nalive and very much kicking there! So we immediately felt at\nhome and the ideas just started flowing. \nBy the time we'd finished we all agreed that each track was \nsuch an integral part of the whole body of work\nthat if it needed to be a double album, then double its going to be!&quot;\n\n\nBitrate: 320 kbps \nChannels: stereo\nSamplerate: 44100\nEncoder: LAME 3.99\nCRC: yes\nCopyright: no\nPrivate: no",
