  "description": "How We Learn: The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens\n\n In the tradition of The Power of Habit and Thinking, Fast and Slow comes a practical, playful, and endlessly fascinating guide to what we really know about learning and memory todayÃ¢â‚¬â€and how we can apply it to our own lives.\n\n From an early age, it is drilled into our heads: Restlessness, distraction, and ignorance are the enemies of success. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re told that learning is all self-discipline, that we must confine ourselves to designated study areas, turn off the music, and maintain a strict ritual if we want to ace that test, memorize that presentation, or nail that piano recital.\n\n But what if almost everything we were told about learning is wrong? And what if there was a way to achieve more with less effort?\n\n In How We Learn, award-winning science reporter Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve your recall? Are there times when distraction is good? Is repetition necessary? CareyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search for answers to these questions yields a wealth of strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday livesÃ¢â‚¬â€and less of a chore.\n\n",
