The Forest Gate fox set out his\nstall as a Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¦ putting it mildly Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¦ angry issues-based young man in thrall\nto Eminem, and would probably have had your eye out if you so much as\nlooked as him funny. This led to an acting sideline in Noel ClarkeÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢s\nAdulthood, as well as a star turn in last years Harry Brown.\n\nNow, a few years on, our Ben has calmed down a bit and returned with a\nconcept album (an accompanying film is in production) that should\nfinally get him known past the gritty urban set, ascending to the\nnational consciousness. The Defamation of Strickland Banks is a\nstory-based soul-up volte-face about a man being wrongly sent dahn, and\nan album that will see Drew added to the list of artists whoÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢ve\ndelivered not-bad debuts, but amazing follow-ups.\n\nA genuine great leap forward, Defamation is a cracker. The two\nbreakthrough singles lead from the front Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¦ Stay Too Long manages to\ncombine the urgency of northern soul with the giddiness of DrewÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢s\nbreathless rap delivery, and the catchier She Said is a welcome\naddition to daytime radio. Elsewhere, on Welcome to Hell he trills like\na scared-to-pick-up-the-soap-in-the-prison-shower Smokey Robinson,\nwhile Hard Times and Love Goes Down are just lovely Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¦ anyone operating\nin the greasy world of pop would give a limb for such songs. PrayinÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢\ncould give Amy Winehouse a run for her old soul beehive, and her recent\nwork hovers over most of the arrangements and styles Ben decides to\nlend his ASBO soul revue. Theres a bit more swearing though, just in\ncase you thought he'd gone totally soft.\n\nDefamation is a great little album which could steer Drew towards being\none of the yearÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢s biggest pop stars, and further onto realising his\nfilm ambitions. Or, perhaps this is just a side-step for him, and hell\ngo krautrock on album three. No matter, if this hasnt shifted the best\npart of a million by 2010s end, then Ill despair. I really will.\nTremendous work.\n\nMORE PLAN B ALBUMS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5494522/Plan_B_-_3_Early_CDs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5494522/Plan_B_-_3_Early_CDs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDELUXE EDITION EXTRA TRACKS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5496009/Plan_B_-_The_Defamation_Of_Strickland_Banks_Bonus_CD-_CMS-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5496009/Plan_B_-_The_Defamation_Of_Strickland_Banks_Bonus_CD-_CMS-&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e513334a081415984f5a5aaf5b159dff877df8f4","amp;dn":"Plan+B+-+The+Defamation+Of+Strickland+Banks+-2010-++SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e513334a081415984f5a5aaf5b159dff877df8f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,19,51,74,8,20,21,152,79,90,90,175,91,21,157,255,135,125,248,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
