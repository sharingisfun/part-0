  "description": "\nOrphan Black, hits the ground running with Sarah in a desperate race to find her missing daughter KiraÃ¢â‚¬â€a wild pursuit that brings her head-to-head with ruthless pro-clone, Rachel, Sarah's scorched earth tactics sparking a war, dividing and imperiling all the clones. This season also rejoins Sarah's clone sisters Alison and Cosima as they struggle to keep their clone world a secret and pick up the pieces of their broken lives - all while dealing with the harsh reality that no one around them can be trusted. As Sarah discovers more about her past, mysterious newcomers appear, but can they be trusted?\n\nAs the mysterious world of Orphan Black widens, new layers of the conspiracy are peeled back. Season one introduced Sarah, whose life changed dramatically after witnessing the suicide of a woman who looked just like her. Sarah learned that, not only were she and the woman clones, but there were others just like them, and dangerous factions at work set on capturing them all. She forged an alliance with fellow clones Alison Hendrix and Cosima Niehaus - and together they've been fighting for their freedom and the safety of their loved ones.\n\nThis season the trio's bond remains strong but they've all made choices that have dire consequences, leaving Sarah to navigate a dangerous world of new enemies and shifting allegiances. She immediately sets off fighting for survival and willing to risk everything to find her missing daughter Kira and foster mother, Mrs. S. Unsure who to trust, Sarah starts an all out war against immense forces. A powerful member of the Dyad group of companies, clone Rachel Duncan, has been tasked with negotiating the allegiance of Sarah and the other clones. She'll stop at nothing to complete her mission, using those who love Sarah as leverage, including confidant Paul Dierden. But Sarah is willing to risk everything and employs scorched earth tactics that inevitably imperil the clones.\n\nAlison, in a fit of desperation to preserve her perfect suburban world, signed a deal with the Dyad Institute to maintain the life of a Stepford wife with husband Donnie and her children - but at what cost? The death of her friend Aynsley and the constant suspicion she's being watched are taking a toll on her sanity. Paralyzed by paranoia, she finds a shoulder to lean on in Sarah's feisty foster brother Felix, who after getting lost in the shuffle of Sarah's life, is happy to finally be needed. Cosima isn't faring any better. Sick with a mysterious illness and facing her mortality, the consequences are severe. Unfortunately, their enemies might be her only hope, and Cosima must work with Dyad Institute scientist and lover, Delphine, to find a cure before it's too late.\n\nMain Cast\n\nTatiana Maslany as Sarah Manning, Beth, Cosima, Alison, Rachel, etc.\nJordan Gavaris as Felix Dawkins\nDylan Bruce as Paul Dierden\nMaria Doyle Kennedy as Siobhan Sadler\nKevin Hanchard as Arthur Bell\nEvelyne Brochu as Delphine Cormier\nMatt Frewer as Dr. Aldous Leekie\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nOverall bit rate : 1 394 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-06-22 08:45:31\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.9.1 ('Blue Panther') 32bit built on Apr 18 2014 18:15:44\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3870515f5078740c1609&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate : 1 010 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2409kMod d6b4e63\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No",
