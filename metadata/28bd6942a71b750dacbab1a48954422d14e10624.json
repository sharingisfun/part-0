  "description": "From the cold darkness of the intergalactic void comes a race of ravenous aliens known as the Tyranids, a numberless horde of super-predators governed only by the instincts to hunt, kill and feed. Each Tyranid is a living weapon, perfectly adapted to its designated function, but each creature is no more than a single cell in a vast gestalt entity controlled by the will of the monstrous Hive Mind. As the Tyranid hive fleets drift through space, they strip all life from the prey worlds in their path, leaving nothing but scoured rock in their wake. \n\nCodex: Tyranids brings the terror of the alien hive fleets to terrible life upon the battlefields of the 41st Millennium. Learn of their violent history, from their first contact with the Imperium to a galaxy wide invasion that threatens to consume Mankind, and about the warrior-organisms of the Tyranids, the living weapons and deadly biomorphs they use and the unique monsters they have created in their quest to devour humanity. Inside, you will also find a stunning showcase featuring the awe-inspiring Tyranid range of Citadel miniatures as well as a comprehensive army list allowing you to forge your Tyranid collection into a powerful army in your games of Warhammer 40,000.",
