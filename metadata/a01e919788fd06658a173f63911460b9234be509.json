Bacevich, &quot;America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History&quot;\r\nISBN: 0553393936 | 2016 | EPUB | 480 pages | 23 MB\r\n\r\nRetired army colonel and New York Times bestselling author Andrew J. Bacevich provides a searing reassessment of U.S. military policy in the Middle East over the past four decades.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of World War II until 1980, virtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in the Greater Middle East. Since 1990, virtually no American soldiers have been killed in action anywhere else. What caused this shift? Andrew J. Bacevich, one of the countryâ€™s most respected voices on foreign affairs, offers an incisive critical history of this ongoing military enterpriseâ€”now more than thirty years old and with no end in sight.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s, Bacevich argues, a great transition occurred. As the Cold War wound down, the United States initiated a new conflictâ€”a War for the Greater Middle Eastâ€”that continues to the present day. The long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union had involved only occasional and sporadic fighting. But as this new war unfolded, hostilities became persistent. From the Balkans and East Africa to the Persian Gulf and Central Asia, U.S. forces embarked upon a seemingly endless series of campaigns across the Islamic world. Few achieved anything remotely like conclusive success. Instead, actions undertaken with expectations of promoting peace and stability produced just the opposite. As a consequence, phrases like â€œpermanent warâ€ and â€œopen-ended warâ€ have become part of everyday discourse.\r\n\r\nConnecting the dots in a way no other historian has done before, Bacevich weaves a compelling narrative out of episodes as varied as the Beirut bombing of 1983, the Mogadishu firefight of 1993, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the rise of ISIS in the present decade. Understanding what Americaâ€™s costly military exertions have wrought requires seeing these seemingly discrete events as parts of a single war. It also requires identifying the errors of judgment made by political leaders in both parties and by senior military officers who share responsibility for what has become a monumental march to folly. This Bacevich unflinchingly does","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01e919788fd06658a173f63911460b9234be509","amp;dn":"America%27s+War+for+the+Greater+Middle+East+%282016%29+Andrew+Bacevich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01e919788fd06658a173f63911460b9234be509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,30,145,151,136,253,6,101,138,23,63,99,145,20,96,185,35,75,229,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
