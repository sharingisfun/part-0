From the acclaimed owner of Brooklynâ€™s Diner, Marlow &amp; Sons, Marlow &amp; Daughters, Reynard, The Ides, Achilles Heel, She Wolf Bakery, Marlow Goods, Romanâ€™s, and the Wythe Hotel comes this debut cookbook capturing a yearâ€™s worth of dishes meant to be shared among friends. Personal and accessible, Dinner at the Long Table brings Tarlowâ€™s keen eye for combining design and taste to a collection of seventeen seasonal menus ranging from small gatherings to blow-out celebrations. The menus encompass memorable feasts and informal dinners and include recipes like a leisurely ragu, followed by fruit and biscotti; paella with tomato toasts, and a Catalan custard; fried calamari sandwiches and panzanella; or a lamb tajine with spiced couscous, pickled carrots, and apricots in honey.\r\n \r\nDinner at the Long Table includes family-style meals that have become a tradition in his home. Written with ANNA DUNN, the editor in chief of the companyâ€™s quarterly magazine Diner Journal, the cookbook is organized by occasion and punctuated with personal anecdotes and photography. Much more than just a beautiful cookbook, Dinner at the Long Table is a thematic exploration into cooking, inspiration, and creativity, with a focus on the simple yet innate human practice of preparing and enjoying food together","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3983708ba12600a3b459688fac7983ad4bc886bf","amp;dn":"Dinner+at+the+Long+Table+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3983708ba12600a3b459688fac7983ad4bc886bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,131,112,139,161,38,0,163,180,89,104,143,172,121,131,173,75,200,134,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
