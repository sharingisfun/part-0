It was confirmed by Telltale Games in July 2012, due to the big success of the game.\n\nYour choices made in Season 1 and the &quot;400 Days&quot; DLC will affect the decisions in Season 2. Although &quot;400 Days&quot; is not a direct part of the story thread joining Seasons 1 and 2, the player's actions in &quot;400 Days&quot; will affect some elements of Season 2. If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t played &quot;400 Days&quot;, the elements that would have been affected will be seamlessly pre-determined by the game.\n\nThe first episode was released on December 17, 2013 for PC/Mac via Steam and PlayStation Network, and on December 18th for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network Europe and iOS. It was also released for PlayStation Vita on April 22, 2014 in North America and on April 23rd in Europe.\n\nA retail disc version of Season 2 will be released later in 2014 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nSEASONS:\n1. &quot;All That Remains&quot;\n2. &quot;A House Divided&quot;\n3. &quot;In Harm's Way&quot;\n4. &quot;Amid The Ruins&quot;\n5. &quot;No Going Back&quot;\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1.
