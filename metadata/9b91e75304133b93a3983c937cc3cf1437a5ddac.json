Will you:\r\n- Undercut your opponents prices to force them out of the market?\r\n- Attain a monopoly and charge an extortionate price for a life-saving cure?\r\n- Walk the middle ground between high volume and high margin and provide a fair product for a fair price?\r\nNew production lines tools are available too! Make your factories more productive than ever by:\r\n- Transferring drugs between buildings!\r\n- Adding all-new Booster Effects to your cures to increase their sale appeal.\r\n- Using Stock Gates to regulate the flow of drugs through your factory in reaction to market demand.\r\nUnlockable perks open up new strategic depths to your strategy.
