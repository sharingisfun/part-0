Mini windows has been further improved, Kaspersky\nRescue Disk is finally perfected and boots equally well from DVD or USB.\nSeveral new utilities have been added or upgraded and some faulty ones have\nbeen fixed. The aim of this Hiren's Boot CD Rebuild is to provide an austere\nbut convenient and usable interface to the utilities whilst keeping faith with\nHiren's original concept. No fancy splash screens or wallpapers. Just hotkeyed\nmenus to get you quickly to the utilities you want to use.\n\nFor more information read File Changelog and .nfo.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:112d67ae23166d72d493038c5776f2670fcf5b75","amp;dn":"Hiren%27s+Boot+DVD+15.2+Restored+Edition+V+1.1+Proteus+%28January+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"112d67ae23166d72d493038c5776f2670fcf5b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,45,103,174,35,22,109,114,212,147,3,140,87,118,242,103,15,207,91,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
