  "description": "Official Site: www.interactivestory.net\n\nI know it is free to download... it is mostly for my friend who can't get to the website\n\nOnly tested on Windows 7 64-bit no guarantee on other systems or OS\n\nGame info\n\nFaÃƒÂ§ade is a prototype of interactive drama, a new genre of character and story-intensive interactive entertainment. FaÃƒÂ§ade is freely downloadable at interactivestory.net. In FaÃƒÂ§ade, you, the player, using your own name and gender, play the character of a longtime friend of Grace and Trip, an attractive and materially successful couple in their early thirties. During an evening get-together at their apartment that quickly turns ugly, you become entangled in the high-conflict dissolution of Grace and TripÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage. No one is safe as the accusations fly, sides are taken and irreversible decisions are forced to be made. By the end of this intense one-act play you will have changed the course of Grace and TripÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ motivating you to re-play the drama to find out how your interaction could make things turn out differently the next time.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS!!!! (please read)\n\nOnce done downloading open the file (installer) it will automatically install. Do not freak out when it says it is decompressing sound it is just to make the file smaller then please seed ",
