  "description": "The Cossacks series has always been noted for having a large number of units on screen simultaneously, and that all are controllable at the same time; this game is no exception. The limit of soldiers that can be used at the same time is 64,000, a large number, compared to other real time strategy video games. Only Rome: Total War or Medieval II: Total War can come close to this number, with ten thousand being the maximum number of soldiers usable at a time.\n\nIn the game, there are two different modes, single-player, and multi-player. In single player, three different modes may be played: campaign (tutorial), Battle for Europe (turn-based, much like Risk), and Skirmish/Historical Battles. In multiplayer, players can play a game over the internet.\n\n\n1. Burn or Mount with Daemon Tools\n\n2. Install The Game\n\n3. Download Patch 1.2 Which will put NOCD 1.2 crack\n\n4. Play Game.... Have Fun\n\n\n\n\nP.S ..I Will Send For A Couple of Hours Everyday.",
