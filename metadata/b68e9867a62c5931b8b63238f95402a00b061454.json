The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68e9867a62c5931b8b63238f95402a00b061454","amp;dn":"Fifty+Shades+of+Grey+%282015%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68e9867a62c5931b8b63238f95402a00b061454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,142,152,103,166,44,89,49,184,182,50,56,249,84,2,160,11,6,20,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
