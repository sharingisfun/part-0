While he spends his days drunk, his kids learn to take care of themselves.\n\nThe show's producers sought to distinguish it from previous American working-class shows by highlighting how Frank's alcoholism affects his family. Paul Abbott, creator of the original, said, &quot;It's not My Name Is Earl or Roseanne. It's got a much graver level of poverty attached to it. It's not blue collar; it's no collar.&quot; When John Wells, the showrunner, began pitching the show, he had to fight efforts to place the show in the South or in a trailer park. He explained, &quot;We have a comedic tradition of making fun of the people in those worlds. The reality is that these people aren't 'the other' Ã¢â‚¬â€ they're people who live four blocks down from you and two blocks over&quot;.\n\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=746618#pid746618&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=746618#pid746618&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD+x264\nFile size:  \t\t550 MiB avg. per episode \nDuration : \t\t53 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976 fps\nAudio:  \t\tMP3/AAC\nNr. of Files:\t\t12 + 1 Trailer + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 15\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n                                      and the release groups\n2HD,ASAP,FQM,LOL,IMMERSE,FEVER,SYS,ORENJI,REWARD,SPASTiKUS,MiXED,MOMENTUM, and all the others (too many to mention them all)\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\nVisit the KABLAM!!! @ forum.suprbay.org\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
