  "description": "Robot Building for Beginners, Third Edition\n\n2015 | ISBN: 1484213602 | English | 492 pages | True PDF | 20 MB\n\n\n&quot;I wrote this book because I love building robots. I want you to love building robots, too. It took me a while to learn about many of the tools and parts in amateur robotics. Perhaps by writing about my experiences, I can give you a head start.&quot;\n--David Cook\nRobot Building for Beginners, Third Edition provides basic, practical knowledge on getting started in amateur robotics. There is a mix of content: from serious reference tables and descriptions to personal stories and humorous bits.\n\nThe robot described and built in this book is battery powered and about the size of a lunch box. It is autonomous; that is, it isn't remote controlled",
