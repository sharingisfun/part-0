  "description": "A DDR Exclusive\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLLYWOOD DIARIES-(2016)\r\n(A film by KD Satyam)\r\n\r\nHindi - DVD.Rip - 720x304 (2.35:1)- 699 MB - x.264.AAC - 1 Hrs:56 Min\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wil5 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wilr \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wile \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wilJ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wil0 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wilz \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wilU \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wilM \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wil9 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wili\r\n\r\nTech Specifications:\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wilQ\r\n\r\nSynopsis:\r\n\r\nRohit (Salim Diwan) is a call centre employee in Delhi, Vishnu (Ashish Vidyarthi) is a retired government employee from Bhilai and Imli (Raima Sen) is a prostitute in Sonagachi the red light area of Kolkata. Three very different people but all with the same burning ambition - to make it big in Bollywood. It is their consuming passion - one that will brook no obstacle. Each tries in his own way and reaches close to their goal and then face the inevitable heartbreak..\r\n\r\nYet they are not the ones to give up. They gather up their broken dreams for yet another attempt..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nThe film may be good, but the DVD certainly does not do it justice. It is badly authored with the scenes almost completely and ligh scenes dull! We have tried to correct the poor authoring, without unduly playing with the scenes. Overall the final rip is a considerable improvement over the original DVD.\r\n\r\nThis is the standard x264 rip of the movie. To follow, in quick succession, are a tiny 450 MB HEVC rip with no compromise on quality and 720p upscale also in x265.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt5216810/",
