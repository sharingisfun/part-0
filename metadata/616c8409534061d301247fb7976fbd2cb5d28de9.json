When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, &quot;The Scopuli,&quot; they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for - and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.\nDetective Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but her parents have money and money talks. When the trail leads him to &quot;The Scopuli&quot; and rebel sympathizer Holden, he realizes that this girl may be the key to everything.\nHolden and Miller must thread the needle between the Earth government, the Outer Planet revolutionaries, and secretive corporations - and the odds are against them. But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one small ship can change the fate of the universe.\n\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:616c8409534061d301247fb7976fbd2cb5d28de9","amp;dn":"Leviathan+Wakes+by+James+S.+A.+Corey+%28The+Expanse+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"616c8409534061d301247fb7976fbd2cb5d28de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,108,132,9,83,64,97,211,1,36,127,183,151,111,189,44,181,210,141,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
