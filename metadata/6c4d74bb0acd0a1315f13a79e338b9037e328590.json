The deal united DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Uni catalogue with the Bang and Columbia material that bookended it, bringing the legendary performerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complete recordings under one roof.\nThe first results of the new Capitol deal is a single-disc retrospective intended to replace the deleted Columbia/Legacy release The Very Best of Neil Diamond. That was the first 1-CD anthology to contain music from all of DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s label affiliations; past compilations had either concentrated on one label or substituted live songs for tracks not controlled by that label.\n\nAll-Time Greatest Hits naturally follows suit. In fact, 19 of the 23 tracks on the new collection from the Kennedy Center Honoree and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer are identical.\n\nAs with The Very Best, All-Time Greatest Hits attempts to prune the prolific artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catalogue of over 30 studio albums (16 of which went Top 10) and over 50 charting singles (37 of which went Top 10). All of DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s No. 1 singles are represented: 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“CracklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Rosie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 1972Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Song Sung BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and 1978Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Bring Me Flowers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ However, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one key difference here. Whereas The Very Best included the chart-topping duet of Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlowersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Barbra Streisand, All-Time Greatest instead features DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original solo version of the song he co-wrote with Alan and Marilyn Bergman. There are eight more Top 10 singles on All-Time Greatest, spanning the period between 1966Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cherry, CherryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and 1980Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello, Again,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love on the RocksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“America,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all from the soundtrack to The Jazz Singer (DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lone previous release on Capitol).\n\nDiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tenure at Bert BernsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ New York-based Bang Records is covered with seven songs produced by the legendary Brill Building team of Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich; the music of this rich period (recently anthologized by Legacy as The Bang Years: 1966-1968) remains the cornerstone of DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, with such titles as Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a BelieverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red Red WineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (both of which scored hit versions by other artists), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girl, YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be a Woman SoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kentucky Woman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ From Bang, Diamond moved to even bigger successes the Uni label. Good times never felt so good as songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet CarolineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“CracklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Rosie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ though Diamond also mined more introspective, moody material like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Play MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and imbued Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brother LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Travelling Salvation ShowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holly HolyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with spiritual fervor.\n\nFrom Uni, it was onto Columbia Records. The singer-songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s initial Columbia release, 1973Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Jonathan Livingston Seagull, was the soundtrack to Hall BartlettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adaptation of Richard BachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novella of the same title. DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grammy- and Golden Globe-winning soundtrack hit No. 2 on the pop albums chart and reportedly earned more than the film itself! Though no tracks from Seagull have made the cut here, Diamond was off and running. 1976Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Beautiful Noise teamed him with The BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Robbie Robertson; its title song appears on the new compilation. Shortly thereafter, Diamond began a collaboration with The Four SeasonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ producer Bob Gaudio, who guided Diamond through hits like Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Bring Me Flowers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“September MornÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (also included here) and the Jazz Singer score.\n\nThough DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pace hardly slowed up, the 1980s arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t represented on the new set beyond The Jazz Singer. 1982Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeartlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (co-written with Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager, and unfortunately not heard here) was his final Top 5 pop hit, but Diamond remained a concert draw and a popular recording artist. His Ã¢â‚¬Å“comebackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ albums produced by Rick Rubin (Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers), 2005Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s 12 Songs and 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Home Before Dark, scored him some of the biggest acclaim of his career, as he returned to writing solo and playing his guitar. Home Before Dark must have been a particularly sweet victory for Diamond when he scored his first-ever No. 1 album! Diamond continued RubinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stark, stripped-down approach with 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s self-produced Dreams, a collection of cover songs largely written by Diamond s contemporaries.)\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missing from All-Time Greatest Hits? Compared to The Very Best, this disc drops Easy Listening chart-topper Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You Know What I MeanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as the Rubin-produced comeback tracks Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pretty Amazing GraceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hell Yeah.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In their place, it adds Ã¢â‚¬Å“September MornÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (No. 17 Pop, No. 2 AC, 1979), Ã¢â‚¬Å“SoolaimonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (No. 30 Pop/No. 5 AC, 1970) and, most oddly, Ã¢â‚¬Å“MorningsideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1972Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Moods. Fans might lament the absence of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Longfellow Serenade,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Heartlight,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Be,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“DesireeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brooklyn Roads,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to name just a few beloved songs that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make the cut either here or on The Very Best.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]",
