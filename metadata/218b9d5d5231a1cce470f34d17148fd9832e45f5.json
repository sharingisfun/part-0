  "description": "\nChet Baker Sings is the debut vocal album by Chet Baker, released in \n1956 by Pacific Jazz Records. \n\nIt is a classic of West Coast cool jazz.\n\nOrnette Coleman's insights are well worth paying attention to, and he certainly hit the nail on the head when discussing Chet Baker's singing. To paraphrase Coleman, Baker may not have had much of a voice, but that didn't stop him from grabbing you with it emotionally. \n\nAs a singer, Baker didn't have had the range of Mel Torme or Billy Eckstine - but he had a soulfulness, a vulnerability that could send chills up your spine. And there's no shortage of soul on Chet Baker Sings, a reissue boasting Pacific Jazz sides from 1954 and 1956.\n \nThis is young Baker with all of his boyish charm, and &quot;cool jazz&quot; doesn't get any more moving than the versions of &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; &quot;Time After Time&quot; and &quot;But Not For Me&quot; found on this CD. A gem that dates back to World War I and laments the death of an army friend in combat, &quot;My Buddy&quot; may have been written before Baker was even born - yet in the trumpeter/singer's hands, it sounds like such a very personal reflection on the value of friendship.\nHighly recommended.\n\n\n\nChet Baker\n\nChet Baker sings\n\n1956\n\n\n\nCD / 1998 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - THAT OLD FEELING\n\n02 - IT'S ALWAYS YOU\n\n03 - LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE\n\n04 - MY IDEAL\n\n05 - I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE\n\n06 - MY BUDDY\n\n07 - BUT NOT FOR ME\n\n08 - TIME AFTER TIME\n\n09 - I GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU VERY WELL\n\n10 - MY FUNNY VALENTINE\n\n11 - THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER YOU\n\n12 - THE THRILL IS GONE\n\n13 - I FALL IN LOVE TOO EASILY\n\n14 - LOOK FOR THE SILVER LINING\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel: \n\nChet Baker (vocals, trumpet)\n\nRuss Freeman (piano, celeste)\n\nJames Bond, Carson Smith (bass)\n\nPeter Littman, Lawrence Marable, Bob Neel (drums)\n\n\n\n\nRecorded at the Forum Theatre, Los Angeles, California on July 23 &amp; 30, 1956 and at Capitol Studios, Hollywood, California on February 15, 1954\n\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n",
