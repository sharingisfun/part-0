He's a slick, seductive role model for the young ambitious Wall Street broker Bud Fox played by Charlie Sheen, who falls into Gecko's sphere of influence and instantly succumbs to the allure of risky deals and generous payoffs. With such perks as a high-rise apartment and women who love men for their money. Charlie is like a worm on Gecko's hook, blind to the corporate maneuvering that puts him at odds with his own father (played by Sheen's offscreen father, Martin).\n\n  Starring: Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Daryl Hannah,  Hal Holbrook, John C. McGinley, Terence Stamp.\n\n  Directed by: Oliver Stone.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 6min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 400\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4db702ab027bde96c9f6920a89b8b8e3c8a50def","amp;dn":"Wall+Street+%281987%29+%28Michael+Douglas%2C+Charlie+Sheen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4db702ab027bde96c9f6920a89b8b8e3c8a50def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,183,2,171,2,123,222,150,201,246,146,10,137,184,184,227,200,165,13,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
