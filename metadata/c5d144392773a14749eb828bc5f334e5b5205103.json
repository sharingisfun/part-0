Or are you looking for more functionality from your scanner than it came with? Download VueScan. It replaces the software that came with your scanner - so you get better scans and a longer life for your hardware.\r\n\r\nFeatures:-\r\n\r\nCompatible with over 2500 Scanners:-\r\n\r\nVueScan is compatible with over 2500 different scanners. The best way to see if your scanner works is to download VueScan (it only takes 60 seconds) You can also check this list of supported scanners.\r\n\r\nVueScan Mobile for iOS and Android:-\r\n\r\nIf you have an iPad, iPhone or Android phone or tablet, you can use VueScan Mobile Free for scanning. This is a completely free program that works with the built-in camera and most networked HP, Canon, Epson, Brother and Samsung scanners.\r\n\r\nOutputs scans in a variety of formats:-\r\n\r\nVueScan can output scanned documents, photos, and film in PDF, JPEG and TIFF formats. It can also recognize text using OCR and create multi-page pdfs using both flatbed scanners and scanners with automatic document feeders\r\n\r\nGreat for Beginner and Pro Users:-\r\n\r\nWe built VueScan so that two completely different types of users can use it. Beginners only need to run VueScan and press the 'Scan' button. Pro users can change to either the 'Standard' or 'Professional' options to unlock powerful features to have complete control over their scans.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in version 9.5.26:-\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Fixed problem with Epson L455 and L850\r\nâ€¢ Fixed problem with some older HP MFP's (e.g. G55)\r\nâ€¢ Improved Italian translation\r\nâ€¢ Fixed problem on high resolution Windows displays\r\nâ€¢ Added support for new Samsung MFP's\r\n- C2670 Series\r\n- C145x Series",
