Green proves once and for all with Black Sands that he is an artist and producer with his sights set on much higher prizes than to rule any dusty subgenre of dance music. This is a record of epic reach and massive emotional pull, all held together by Green's understanding of composition and arrangement of live instruments (most of them also played by him) as well as his complete mastery of the tricks and techniques of the digital age. Black Sands is the most contemporary record he has ever made.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:625a49c94557df787ba1d0f0087c3ee73a0c4544","amp;dn":"Bonobo+-+Black+Sands+%5Bmp3-320-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"625a49c94557df787ba1d0f0087c3ee73a0c4544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,90,73,201,69,87,223,120,123,161,208,240,8,124,62,231,58,12,69,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
