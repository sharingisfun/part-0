With Nathgari eerily smothered in red dust and darkness, the townsfolk join the search led by local cop, David Rae. It soon becomes apparent that something terrible may have happened to Tommy and Lily. Suspicions run riot, rumours spread and public opinion turns savagely against the Parkers. With temperatures rising and the chances of survival plummeting with each passing day, Catherine and Matthew find themselves pushed to the brink as they struggle to survive the mystery of their children's fate. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e723e18f72364283e220f8b218c90aac66d53d09","amp;dn":"Strangerland+%282015%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e723e18f72364283e220f8b218c90aac66d53d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,35,225,143,114,54,66,131,226,32,248,178,24,201,10,172,102,213,61,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
