The game was officially announced as Respawn's debut game at Microsoft's E3 2013 press conference, and was released on March 11, 2014.\n\nIn Titanfall, players fight on a war-torn planet in six-on-six online multiplayer-only matches as mech-style Titans and their pilots. The game's action is fast-paced: as pilots, players can run along walls and link jumps together parkour-style, as well as cloak; as Titans, players are equipped with more destructive armaments and special protective shields. Several gameplay elements were designed to increase the game's accessibility to less experienced shooter players, such as a locking pistol, the supplementing of each team with weak AI bots for easier kills, and temporary power-ups. The game uses Microsoft's cloud computing services to offload non-player activity to servers and optimize the home computer for graphical performance.\n\nThe game won over 60 awards at its E3 2013 reveal, including a record-breaking six E3 Critics Awards, and Best of Show from several media outlets. It also won official awards at Gamescom and the Tokyo Game Show. Many reviewers predicted Titanfall to be the next step for the first-person shooter genre, and IGN's Ryan McCaffrey declared the game &quot;Microsoft's killer app&quot;. Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the game for its balanced game design.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4c62c544e235dcee8be74513a7c7029b7287a3f","amp;dn":"Titanfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4c62c544e235dcee8be74513a7c7029b7287a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,198,44,84,78,35,93,206,232,190,116,81,58,124,112,41,183,40,122,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
