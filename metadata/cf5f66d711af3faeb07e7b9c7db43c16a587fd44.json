Bitcoin is the first successful digital currency. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instant, global, frictionless and it is changing money forever. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and yet it has already spawned an economy valued at nearly $2 billion that is growing exponentially. Established companies like PayPal are considering adding bitcoin as a payment method, and investors are funding a flurry of new startups aiming to stake claims in a new industry that may rival the Internet in terms of scale and impact on daily life.\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested in learning more about the technical operation of bitcoin, or if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re building the next great bitcoin killerÃ‚Â­app or business, you will find this book essential reading. From the basic use of a bitcoin wallet to buy a cup of coffee, to running a bitcoin marketplace with hundreds of thousands of transactions, or collaboratively building new financial innovations that will transform our understanding of currency and credit, this book will help you engineer money. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to unlock the API to a new economy. This book is your key.",
