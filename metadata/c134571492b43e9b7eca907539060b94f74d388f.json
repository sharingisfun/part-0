  "description": "FILE INFO\n\nTITLE: Earthlings\nYEAR: 2006\nGENRE: Documentary\nRUNTIME: 01:35:27\nIMDB RATING: 8.5/10\nAUDIO BITRATE: 224 kbps \nVIDEO DATA RATE: 136 kbps\nVIDEO SAMPLE SIZE: 12 bit\nVIDEO COMPRESSION: XviD\nRESOLUTION: 496 x 368\nSubtitles: Chinese, English, Francais, Espanol, German, Greek, Russian, Portuguese, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, Galacian\nSIZE: 988 MB\nSOURCE: NTSC Multi Region DVD\n\nNOTES\n\nTAGLINE: Make The Connection\nDIRECTOR: Shaun Monson\nWRITER: Shaun Monson\nCOMPOSER: Moby\nNARRATOR: Joaquin Phoenix\n\nI used AutoGK to encode the film. I used Virtualdub to organize the film into regular parts just as in the DVD. Finally, I used Subrip\nto extract the subtitles from the DVD.\n\nThis is the only release on the internet that has DvDrip quality plus extended edition stuff with it.\n\nThe quality is the same as in the DVD, there is no part in the film that is interlaced or pixely as other releases. The video might be blurry in certain parts because it was shot undercover with handled cameras, it's blurry in the DVD too.\n\nTo play the avi files, You must have XviD codec.\nTo play the subtitles, you must have vobsub.\nBoth are downloadble and free.\n\nTo use the subtitles, simply cut or copy the desired language file and paste it in the main folder with 'Earthlings.avi' file.\n\nSubtitles are only for the main film, and do not support the extended edition files.\n\nIf you don't want the extra features, then all you have to do is to uncheck them on opening the .torrent file. \n\nPLZ watch this movie. That's all I ask. It will leave you speechless.",
