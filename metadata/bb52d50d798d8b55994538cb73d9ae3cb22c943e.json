Pumbaa suggests telling the audience their story, which begins before Simba's journey begins. Through this, we meet Timon's mother and Uncle Max, discover why he left his meerkat colony, where he learned Hakuna Matata, how he meets Pumbaa, and the perils they encountered while searching for their dream home. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb52d50d798d8b55994538cb73d9ae3cb22c943e","amp;dn":"The+Lion+King+1+1%2F2+%282004%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb52d50d798d8b55994538cb73d9ae3cb22c943e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,82,213,13,121,141,139,85,153,69,56,203,115,217,174,60,178,44,148,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
