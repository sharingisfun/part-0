Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is comfortable in her life as a bail bonds collector when Henry -- the child she gave up a decade earlier -- suddenly shows up. He is convinced that she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, who sent her away before the Evil Queen could cast a spell freezing the Fairytale world in time and bringing them to our world. After returning Henry home, Emma decides to stay in town to keep an eye on him and discovers he may not be wrong after all.\n\n[Media]: video/H264\n[Format]: x264\n[Resolution]: 720x404 px\n[AspectRatio]: 16:9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9008fb2c79961e14e39b214b118f8380970bfeb","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Time+Season+4+Complete+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9008fb2c79961e14e39b214b118f8380970bfeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,0,143,178,199,153,97,225,78,57,178,20,177,24,248,56,9,112,191,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
