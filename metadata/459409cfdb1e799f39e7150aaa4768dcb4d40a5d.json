It is an ideal tool for developing videos to demonstrate features of a new software or any other task that requires the capture of desktop activity.\n\nThe program is easy to use, and you can select an area or full desktop for recording. You can adjust the video quality settings to reduce file size, use custom cursors and add a soundtrack through your microphone or speakers.\n\nFurthermore, you can add screen captions to your desktop while recording. These captions are anti-aliased, high quality images that support text display in multiple languages.\n\nWith the Video Annotation feature, you can also personalize your movie by including a webcam movie of yourself into the AVI.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459409cfdb1e799f39e7150aaa4768dcb4d40a5d","amp;dn":"CamStudio.2.7.r316+%5BEXE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459409cfdb1e799f39e7150aaa4768dcb4d40a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,148,9,207,219,30,121,159,57,231,21,10,170,71,104,220,180,212,10,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
