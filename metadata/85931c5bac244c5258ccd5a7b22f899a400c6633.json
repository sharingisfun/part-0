Restart your device and check your map info via : Tools&gt;Settings&gt;Map&gt;Map Info.\nWhy the renaming?\nThis must be done because this is not the primary mapset as it is being used from the SD card.

Insert the SD card into your Garmin GPS, and browse to your map information on your Garmin GPS and you should see the new maps selected.
