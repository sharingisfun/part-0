The series began in Kodansha's Bessatsu ShÅnen Magazine on September 9, 2009, and has been collected into 17 tankÅbon volumes as of August 2015. It is set in a world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by enormous walls as a defense against the Titans, gigantic humanoids that eat humans seemingly without reason. The story initially centers on Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and childhood friend Armin Arlert, who joins the military to fight the Titans after their home town is invaded and Eren's mother is eaten. However, as the story progresses and the truths about the Titans are slowly revealed to the reader, the narrative shifts to encompass Historia Reiss, squad leader Levi, and other supporting characters.\r\n\r\n[PLOT - SPOILER ALERT]\r\n\r\nOver 100 years before the beginning of the story, giant humanoid creatures called Titans (å·¨äºº Kyojin) suddenly appeared and nearly wiped out humanity, devouring them without remorse or reason. What remains of humanity now resides within three enormous concentric walls: the outermost is Wall Maria (ã‚¦ã‚©ãƒ¼ãƒ«ãƒ»ãƒžãƒªã‚¢ WÅru Maria); the middle wall is Wall Rose (ã‚¦ã‚©ãƒ¼ãƒ«ãƒ»ãƒ­ãƒ¼ã‚¼ WÅru RÅze, pronounced like rosÃ©) and the innermost is Wall Sina (ã‚¦ã‚©ãƒ¼ãƒ«ãƒ»ã‚·ãƒ¼ãƒŠ WÅru ShÄ«na, alt. &quot;Wall Sina&quot;). Inside these walls, humanity has lived in peace for one hundred years; many people growing up without ever having seen a Titan. This all changes when one day, a giant 50-meter (160 ft)-tall Titan mysteriously appears after a strike of lightning and breaches the outer wall of the Shiganshina district, a town at Wall Maria, allowing the smaller Titans to invade the district. An Armored Titan smashes clean through Wall Maria, forcing mankind to abandon the land between Wall Maria and Wall Rose, evacuating the remaining population into the inner districts. The sudden influx of population causes turmoil and famine.\r\n\r\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\r\n\r\nSource: BD / Torrent: Attack on Titan (Shingeki no...Audio) (1920x1080) [Phr0stY]\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Container: MKV\r\nVideo Format: h.265/HEVC [8-bit]\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n\r\nAudio Type: Mixed\r\nTrack 1: English (5.1 Channel Surround)\r\nTrack 2: Japanese (2 Channel Stereo)\r\nAudio Format: AAC-HE\r\n\r\nSubtitle Language: English\r\nSubtitle Format: SSA\r\n*MISSING SUBTITLE FONTS HAVE BEEN ADDED AND STYLES CORRECTED FROM ORIGINAL RELEASE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a598df91b7e6932177b1bc6c199389e68af15d87","amp;dn":"Attack+on+Titan+Season+1+%5BDUAL-AUDIO%5D+%5B1080p%5D+%5BHEVC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a598df91b7e6932177b1bc6c199389e68af15d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,152,223,145,183,230,147,33,119,177,188,108,25,147,137,230,138,241,93,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
