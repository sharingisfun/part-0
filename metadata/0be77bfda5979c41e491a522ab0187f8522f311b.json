Described as an anthology series, each season is conceived as a self-contained miniseries, following a disparate set of characters and settings, and a storyline with its own &quot;beginning, middle, and end&quot;.\n\n\nPlot:\n----------\nAmerican Horror Story: Asylum, the second season of the American FX horror television series American Horror Story, originally aired from October 17, 2012 to January 23, 2013. Announced on October 31, 2011, the premise of the second season marks a departure from that of the series' first season, featuring all new characters and a new location. Thus, American Horror Story has been deemed an anthology series. American Horror Story: Asylum begins in 1964 at the Briarcliff Mental Institution, following the stories of the patients, doctors and nuns who occupy it, and intercuts with events in the past and present.\n\n\n\nCast: Jessica Lange\n      Evan Peters\n      Zachary Quinto\n      Joseph Fiennes\n      James Cromwell\n      Lizzie BrocherÃƒÂ©\n      Lily Rabe\n      Sarah Paulson\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChannels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/9088/vlcsnap2013061120h13m07.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/9088/vlcsnap2013061120h13m07.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1602/vlcsnap2013061120h13m51.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1602/vlcsnap2013061120h13m51.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/1075/vlcsnap2013061120h14m29.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/1075/vlcsnap2013061120h14m29.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/2084/vlcsnap2013061120h16m49.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/2084/vlcsnap2013061120h16m49.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/7858/vlcsnap2013061120h17m47.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/7858/vlcsnap2013061120h17m47.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIMDb:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fxnetworks.com/ahs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fxnetworks.com/ahs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n\nOther CARG releases can be found at ExtraTorrent\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be77bfda5979c41e491a522ab0187f8522f311b","amp;dn":"American+Horror+Story+Season+2+Asylum+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be77bfda5979c41e491a522ab0187f8522f311b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,231,123,253,165,151,156,65,228,145,165,34,171,1,135,248,82,47,49,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
