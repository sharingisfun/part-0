I'll use this repack as my index as opposed to my previous Sims 4 repack ...\r\n\r\nNote : The Sims 4 now supports 64 bit :) you'll see 2 exe's in your install directory after installing the update ....\r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nIf u already had any version of Sims 4 installed, uninstall it and make sure there is no 'The Sims 4' folder in (My) DocumentsElectronic Arts directory after uninstalling the game. (Backup your saves and make sure no registry keys are left from previous Sims 4 game )\r\n\r\nDISABLE YOUR ANTIVIRUS BEFORE RUNNING SETUP (IMPORTANT) ,, same for uninstall.....(For avast users: Just Disable DeepScreen in antivirus settings), in your antivirus , create an exception for the folder in which you are going to install the game ...\r\n\r\nAfter running setup,, click on 'Configure',, specify the install directory for which u created an exception in your antivirus ,,  Install here , for Example :\r\n C:/The Sims 4 Deluxe Edition\r\n OR\r\n D:/The Sims 4 Deluxe Edition\r\n OR \r\n any other drive other than the default one\r\n \r\nPlease , specify the install directory yourself , don't install in the default install directory ,, after that ,, click on next and next,, select the necessary software (Direct X,visual c++ x86,visual c++ x64[not for x86 users] ,, again next,, finally on 'Install'....\r\n\r\nPLEASE , PLEASE ADD THE SIMS 4 GAME FOLDER TO THE EXCLUSION/EXCEPTION LIST OF YOUR ANTIVIRUS OTHERWISE YOUR ANTIVIRUS WILL CHANGE THE 'TS4.exe' FILE INTO A TEMPORARY FILE OR JUST DELETE IT WHICH WON'T LET THE GAME TO RUN, AFTER THIS STEP, YOU CAN ENABLE YOUR ANTIVIRUS...\r\n\r\nPlay the game from DESKTOP SHORTCUTS or install directory. ALWAYS OPEN THE GAME USING RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR ....\r\n\r\n TIPS:\r\n\r\n -If u have Origin installed and play the game with it enabled, then the DLCs will get disabled , completely exit origin and then play the game ...\r\n\r\n -If the game asks for Origin to be running , then it means your antivirus has blocked the crack, it's advised to create an exception for The Sims 4 folder to avoid this, make sure u have taken care of Windows Defender apart from your primary antivirus .... \r\n\r\n -Windows defender is the default antivirus , Go to windows defender, then go to the history tab. View details on quarantined items, and restore VirTool. Then go to the settings and scroll down to exclusions. Add RldOrigin.dll to the list. \r\n\r\n -Don't skip instally both vcredist_x86 and vcredist_x64 updates ....\r\n\r\n If it still crashes, lower the graphics settings from options ingame and make sure you meet the system requirements. There is a 'laptop mode' for running it on low end laptops. I run it on a laptop on ultra settings without this mode. It's much better optimised than Sims 3.\r\n\r\n IF U R STILL UNABLE TO GET IT WORKING, INBOX ME AT KICKASS OR ON MYPAGE ....\r\n\r\n IF YOU LIKE THE REPACK,, GIVE FEEDBACK AND SEED.......\r\n\r\n LIKE THE GAME,, BUY IT AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS.......\r\n\r\nCheck out my Official FB page\r\nMr DJ repacks\r\nLike it guys to support and get updates on upcoming repacks",
