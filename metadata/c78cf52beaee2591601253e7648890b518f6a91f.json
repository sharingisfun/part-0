  "description": "The Kooks Inside In Inside Out(mp3 320kbs)ICM369\n________________________________________________\n\nOn their debut album Inside In/Inside Out, Brighton band The Kooks \ndemonstrate a real potential for greatness. \n\nThat's because this young band have two crucial things going for \nthem: a wealth of ideas and an awareness of their place in their \nmusical lineage. Which is why it's probably so appropriate that \nInside In/Inside Out was recorded at The Kinks' Ray Davies' own \nstudio--Kooks frontman Luke Pritchard, like Davies, seems to have \na knack for churning out catchy guitar-pop nuggets. \n\nSo, after the brief and mellow intro of &quot;Seaside&quot;, the album really \nkicks in to grab the listener by the ears, with each song better than \nthe previous. Sofa Song&quot; is a strumming, singalong bounce, but \n&quot;Eddie's Gun&quot; is a rough-around-the-edges jangly rocker, and &quot;Ooh La&quot; \nis a mellow and melodic stroll, all building up to the downright funky \ntracks like &quot;Matchbox&quot; and &quot;Naive&quot;. nd so it continues, through 14 songs, \npropelled by Pritchard's hiccupping vocal delivery and Hugh Harris's \nrather excellent guitar playing. \n\nThe Kooks had a lot of hype prior to the release of Inside In/Inside Out; \nrather impressively, they've more than managed to live up to it.\n\n______________________________________________\n\n1.
