Advanced PDF Password Recovery instantly unlocks PDF documents that restrict you of printing, editing or copying of data to clipboard. This is by far the most common protection found in PDF files. If you can open a document without a password, but cannot print it at all or are restricted to low-quality output, or if you cannot copy data to clipboard or cannot edit the document, read no further and get Advanced PDF Password Recovery Standard edition!\nPasswords to Open\n\nWhat if you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t open a PDF document at all without knowing the correct password? In that case, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need the password recovery feature found in the Professional and Enterprise editions of Advanced PDF Password Recovery.\nThe PDF format specifies two types of protection: the weak 40-bit and the strong 128-bit encryption. Advanced PDF Password Recovery guarantees the recovery of 40-bit keys by attacking the encryption key instead of attempting to guess the password. While the Professional edition takes up to several days to recover a PDF document protected with a 40-bit key, the Enterprise edition can unlock an encrypted PDF in a matter of minutes!\nThunder TablesÃ‚Â® Technology (Patented)\n\nThe unique Thunder TablesÃ‚Â® technology developed by ElcomSoft uses pre-computed tables to significantly speed up the recovery of 40-bit keys. The technology is available in the Enterprise edition, and will unlock a protected document in a matter of minutes instead of days.\nStrong Password Recovery\n\nIf the PDF is protected with a strong 128-bit or 256-bit key, Advanced PDF Password Recovery performs a range of attacks on the PDF file document in order to obtain the original password. But even then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not left without options!\nDictionary Attack\n\nMost passwords used by living beings are based on a word or phrase. Performing a dictionary attack by attempting different combinations of cases and variations of words and characters before reverting to a comprehensive brute-force attack allows for considerate time savings shall the attack succeed.\nBrute Force Attack\n\nIf the password does not fall into any dictionary, Advanced PDF Password Recovery attempts all possible combinations of passwords by performing the brute force attack. The highly optimized low-level code provides the best-in-class performance for the brute-force password recovery. Multi-threaded optimization ensures optimum performance on the modern multi-core CPUs.\n\nSystem Requirements:\t\n\nSupported Operating Systems: Windows 2000, Windows 7 (32 bit), Windows 7 (64 bit), Windows Server 2003/2008, Windows Vista (32 bit), Windows Vista (64 bit), Windows XP, Windows 8, Windows 8.1\nAbout 6 MB of free space on hard disk\nAdministrator privileges are recommended (to use some program features)\n\nHomepage: http://www.elcomsoft.com/apdfpr.html\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.",
