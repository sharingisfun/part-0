  "description": "0.03.H3 CHANGE LOG\n\nBug Fixes\nSaving Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fixed a bug with Steam attempting to initialize twice and throwing an exception. This would result in not being able to continue the correct saved game after quitting to the main menu without quitting to desktop and restarting.\nAntibiotics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Removed conditions for anti-venom item which didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it into the last update and reverted to using antibiotics to cure poisoning and vitamins for sickness as before.\nMain Menu Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reports had been made of seeing the main menu logo with no menu options. This couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be replicated but changes were made in an effort to fix anything that could have been the cause. Please keep us posted if you experience any more issues.\nIntro Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Changed key binding for skipping the intro to [Esc] to fix interfering with AZERTY keyboards.\nTorch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fixed bug where you couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pick up the permanently equipped torch if you have a full inventory.\nCampfire Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reduced flame distortion to more realistic level. Cleaned up prefab.\n\nNew Content\nLoading Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The loading screen now has a courtesy warning for Yosemite users for long wait times.\nLoading Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The loading screen now displays tips",
