The flock spend their time disobeying the sheepdog Bitzer, and ensuring that the farmer doesn&amp;#039;t discover how organised they are.\n\nWith no spoken dialogue the programme is suitable for all nationalities, and indeed is broadcast in dozens of countries across the world. There&amp;#039;s great slapstick humour to appeal to kids, along with lots of homages to classic movie and television that adults will enjoy spotting.\n\nThese episodes were captured from a high-definition DVB-T broadcast - with no watermarking or annoying advertising crawlers - and then downscaled slightly to 960 x 540 pixels. The episodes look like they&amp;#039;re straight from DVD, only with better resolution!\n\nI tried to add a full-resolution screen capture to this post to give an idea of the size of the episodes when played, but Demonoid didn&amp;#039;t seem to let me link an image that large! The image at the top of this post was captured from an episode, the logo added and was then scaled to 50% ... so the actual videos are double the height and width of that image, if it helps to know.\n\nNote that although the AVI files use standard codecs (XviD/MP3), the higher resolution of the video stream means that you may not be able to play these files on a stand-alond disc player or console. If you just watch your shows at your computer though - or (like me) have a computer-based media player in your lounge - then you should be fine.\n\n\n\n\nFILE INFORMATION\n\nNumber of files: 40\nTotal file size: 4260 MB (approximately one single-layer DVD)\n\nSource: 1280 x 720 progressive DVB-T PAL broadcast\nResolution: 960 x 540 progressive (16:9)\nFrames per second: 25\n\nVideo format: XviD, ~1950 kbps\nAudio format: MP3, 44 KHz, 192 kbps CBR, Stereo\n\nSubtitles: None\nLanguage: English (which really only affects the intro and closing credits)\n\nWatermarks/advertising: Nothing at all on Series 1.
