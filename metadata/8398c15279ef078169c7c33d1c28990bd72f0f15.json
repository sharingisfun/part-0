It can also be used as a virtual modular control system and integrated into blended learning concepts. Version 4 features outstanding dynamic simulation, many new components and enhanced didactic material.\n\nThe lesson preparation tool\n\nWindows functionality: drag &amp; drop, copy &amp; paste, context-sensitive menus\nCopying of text and graphics to Word and PowerPoint\nPrint preview, scaling and printing in all formats\nIntegrated slide show: basic circuits, animated sectional views, instructional units, support for many Windows-compatible image and multimedia file formats\nIntegrated fundamentals for pneumatics and hydraulics on video CD\nRealistic simulations in real time\n\nCalculation of pressure build-up and flow rate, current and voltage\nConsideration of characteristic data for calculating the pressure drop in valves\nRealistic switching times\nCalculation of piston acceleration and speed taking into consideration inertia, stiction and sliding friction, leakage and end position cushioning\nProportional and closed-loop-control technology\nDigital technology in accordance with Siemens LOGO! Soft\nCylinder and directional control valve configurator\nLearn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ simulate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ apply: \nFluidSIMÃ‚Â® in blended learning concepts\n\nUser-friendly project administration\nDetailed description of all components, in most cases with colour illustrations\nApplication examples in video CD format\nStandard-compliant symbol libraries according to DIN ISO 1219\nIntegrated learning training program as the ideal complement to Festo's other learning training programs\nVariable network licenses or software activation via Internet\nDynamic simulation\nThe new simulator, which rivals those found in much more expensive professional programs, permits the simulation of dynamic effects such as pressure build-up, inertia, acceleration, stiction and sliding friction. Systems with open-loop and closed-loop control can be simulated.\n\nCircuit diagram creation\nThe component library has been greatly extended in comparison with Version 3.6. All the components are shown in clearly structured trees. In addition to the enhanced valve configurator, a flexible cylinder configurator is now also available.\n\nDocumentation\nFlexible, highly detailed diagrams with automatic optimum scaling. Automatic current path numbering, logic element tables, terminal designations and terminal allocation lists in electrical circuits. Function diagram editor and parts list generator.\n\nOPC and EasyPort Ã¢â‚¬â€œ open the gateway to the world of 24 volts systems\nFluidSIMÃ‚Â® can also communicate with other applications. This makes it extremely easy to use FluidSIMÃ‚Â® for process simulation.\n\nDidactic material\nExtended and updated didactic material. Comprehensive descriptions of the physical/-mathematical models of the components used in FluidSIMÃ‚Â®. A detailed learning training program makes it easier to get started with simulation using FluidSIMÃ‚Â®.\n\nMini control system with 16 I/O\nComplete mini control system as a logic module with up to 16 inputs and outputs that can access the EasyPort via OPC or directly.\n\nNOTE: THIS PORTABLE VERSION IS A WORK OF TEAM NANBAN/594mgnav. IT WORKS 100%.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on- google TEAM NANBAN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8398c15279ef078169c7c33d1c28990bd72f0f15","amp;dn":"Festo+Fluidsim+pneumatic+and+hydraulic+4.2%28Cracked%29%5BTeam+Nanban%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8398c15279ef078169c7c33d1c28990bd72f0f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,152,193,82,121,239,7,129,105,199,195,61,28,40,153,11,215,47,15,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
