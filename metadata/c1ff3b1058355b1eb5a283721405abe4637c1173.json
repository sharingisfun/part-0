  "description": "The following torrent is one that I created with my collection of Nintendo 64 ROMS in n64 and z64 formats. It also includes my favorite N64 emulator for PC: Project64 1.7 (latest version as of 2013) Project64 is the most up-to-date and compatible N64 emulator out there and I personally have never found a game that didn't work with it! Check out the list above to see what games are included!\n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, check out my other Nintendo game collections:\n\n\n\n\n The roms here are a mix of games including some exclusive to the JAP and EUR markets (that you can now play with the help of the emulator! :D). So have fun going through these roms, I know I have.\n\n\n\n Also, I dare anyone to name an N64 game that isn't in this torrent. I realize it's probably not EVERYTHING ever released, but really, can you name something that's not here? xD\n\nInstalling/Using Project64:\n\n 1. Open the folder entitled &quot;Emulator&quot; within the downloaded torrent.\n 2. Open Project64.1.7.0.50.Ver.23.rar with a program such as WinRar or 7-zip\n 3. Extract to somewhere on your computer.\n 4. Run Project64.exe to start the emulator, make shortcuts if desired.\n 5. Go to File--&gt;Choose Rom Directory... and choose the location of the roms on your computer.\n\n\n\n And your done, you should have a list of roms in your emulator and be good to go. Just double click a game to play it! You can also use a gamepad if you got it.\n\nThese roms are compatible with ANY N64 emulator out there. If you happen to be using OSX or Linux you can use mupen64+ instead.\n\n Anyway, hope you guys enjoy my latest torrent. Don't forget to SEED!",
