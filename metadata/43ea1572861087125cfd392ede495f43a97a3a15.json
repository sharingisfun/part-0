  "description": "The Maze Runner Trilogy - Books 1, 2 &amp; 3 by James Daschner\n\nmobi, epub &amp; pdf formats\n__________________________________________________________\n\nBook #1 - The Maze Runner:\n\n\nWhen Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. \n\nHis memory is blank. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not alone. When the liftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doors open, Thomas finds \n\nhimself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the GladeÃ¢â‚¬â€a large, open expanse surrounded \n\nby stone walls.\n\nJust like Thomas, the Gladers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know \n\nis that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every \n\nnight theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve closed tight. \n\nAnd every 30 days a new boy has been delivered in the lift.\n\nThomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent upÃ¢â‚¬â€the first girl to ever arrive in \n\nthe Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers. \n\nThomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark \n\nsecrets buried within his mind.\n\n==========================================================\n\nBook #2 - The Scorch Trials:\n\n\nSolving the Maze was supposed to be the end. No more puzzles. No more variables. And no \n\nmore running. Thomas was sure that escape meant he and the Gladers would get their lives \n\nback. But no one really knew what sort of life they were going back to.\n\nIn the Maze, life was easy. They had food, and shelter, and safety . . . until Teresa \n\ntriggered the end. In the world outside the Maze, however, the end was triggered long ago.\n\nBurned by sun flares and baked by a new, brutal climate, the earth is a wasteland. \n\nGovernment has disintegratedÃ¢â‚¬â€and with it, orderÃ¢â‚¬â€and now Cranks, people covered in festering\n\nwounds and driven to murderous insanity by the infectious disease known as the Flare, \n\nroam the crumbling cities hunting for their next victim . . . and meal.\n\nThe Gladers are far from finished with running. Instead of freedom, they find themselves \n\nfaced with another trial. They must cross the Scorch, the most burned-out section of the \n\nworld, and arrive at a safe haven in two weeks. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the \n\nvariables and stack the odds against them.\n\nThomas can only wonderÃ¢â‚¬â€does he hold the secret of freedom somewhere in his mind? Or will he\n\nforever be at the mercy of WICKED?\n\n==========================================================\n\nBook #3 - The Death Cure:\n\n\nThomas knows that Wicked can't be trusted, but they say the time for lies is over, that \n\nthey've collected all they can from the Trials and now must rely on the Gladers, with full \n\nmemories restored, to help them with their ultimate mission. It's up to the Gladers to \n\ncomplete the blueprint for the cure to the Flare with a final voluntary test.\n\nWhat Wicked doesn't know is that something's happened that no Trial or Variable could have \n\nforeseen. Thomas has remembered far more than they think. And he knows that he can't \n\nbelieve a word of what Wicked says.\n\nThe time for lies is over. But the truth is more dangerous than Thomas could ever imagine.\n\nWill anyone survive the Death Cure?\n\n==========================================================\n",
