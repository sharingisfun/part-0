Guetta had been DJing around France playing popular tunes, but his brain was particularly rewired in 1987 when he heard a Farley Jackmaster Funk track on French radio. He taped the track, brought a copy to a gig, and promptly cleared the floor with it during one of his own sets. Things loosened up a year later when acid house came to France and Guetta successfully promoted his own club nights. It was during one of those nights in 1992 that he met Robert Owens, a Chicago-based house legend who was touring across Europe at the time. Guetta played Owens some of his own tracks, and Owens picked one he liked enough to sing over. The result was &quot;Up and Away,&quot; a minor hit that lurked in garage DJ crates for the next four years.\n\n\n\n\n-------[Discography]----------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust A Little More Love (2002)\nGuetta Blaster (2004)\nPop Life (2007)\nOne Love (2009)\nNothing But The Beat (2011)\n\n\n\n-------[Settings]-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist: David Guetta\nBit Rate: 320 kbps\nSource: iTunes\nEncoded by: theLEAK\nCopyright: theLEAK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:059bec37676b68617bcecd6b2688c4ed7cef0f5b","amp;dn":"David+Guetta+Discography+%28iTunes+Edition%29+%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"059bec37676b68617bcecd6b2688c4ed7cef0f5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,155,236,55,103,107,104,97,123,206,205,107,38,136,196,237,124,239,15,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
