IB instead chose to use PROPER/RELOADEDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retail release of Mass Effect, along with SiMONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s No-DVD executable so that both BDtS and Pinnacle Station should work. If you are experiencing texture corruption on Therum or Pinnacle Station, please make sure your graphics drivers are up to date. Please also clear the local shader cache (in the Mass Effect launcher), that should do the trick.\n\n###Razor1911 (Mass Effect 2 RETAIL Release)\n\nThis is NOT the pre-release ISO that was leaked two weeks prior to Mass Effect 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Release. The installer is the RETAIL installer and a separate menu allows for installation and patching of the DLCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Please be sure to block Mass Effect 2.exe with windows (or your favorite) firewall.\n\n###RELOADED (ME3 Extended Cut)\n\nTo install the games, simply use the Autorun menu provided on this Bluray ISO release. It should do the trick in helping to install all games and their content.\n\n\n----------.::Content::.----------\n\n- Complete Mass Effect Comic Collection.\n\n=Mass Effect=\n\n- Base Game.\n- Update 1.02 \n- Bring Down the Sky DLC.\n- Pinnacle Station DLC.\n- Original Mass Effect Font.\n- Interviews with Seth Green &amp; VO Cast.\n- Faunts M4 (Part II) Music Video.\n- Original Mass Effect Soundtrack.\n- Prima Official Strategy Guide.\n- Fan Made Extended Trailer.\n- 10 1080p HD Wallpapers.\n\n=Mass Effect 2=\n\n- Base Game.\n- Update 1.02\n- All 22 DLC's.\n- DLC Unlocker.\n- Unnecessary Censorship in Mass Effect 2.\n- Art of the Game Interviews.\n- Fight For The Lost Crew Interviews.\n- N7 Developers Diary.\n- The Stars of Mass Effect 2 Interview.\n- SyFy Special: Sci vs. Fi\n- Original Mass Effect 2 Soundtrack.\n- Prima Official Strategy Guide.\n- Mass Effect 2 Extended 'Blur' Trailer.\n- 12 1080p HD Wallpapers.\n\n=Mass Effect 3=\n\n- Base Game (From Ashes and Collectors Edition Content pre-installed).\n- Update 1.03.\n- Extended Cut DLC.\n- Unnecessary Censorship in Mass Effect 3 by Normal Difficulty.\n- Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut Interview.\n- BioWare Pulse - A More Dynamic Shepard.\n- BioWare Pulse - Mass Effect 3 Combat.\n- BioWare Pulse - Mass Effect Cinematics.\n- BioWare Pulse - Mass Effect Invasion.\n- BioWare Pulse - Special Edition!\n- BioWare Pulse - Voice Over Recording.\n- BioWare Pulse - Writing for Mass Effect 3.\n- BioWare Pulse ep1 - Mass Effect E3 Edition.\n- BioWare Pulse ep2 - SWTOR and Mass Effect at E3.\n- BioWare Pulse ep3 - Behind the Scenes at the E3 Press Demo.\n- Fan Q&amp;A with Casey Hudson.\n- Mass Effect 3 Voice Cast Reveal.\n- Original Mass Effect 3 Soundtrack.\n- Mass Effect 3 Live Action Trailer.\n- Mass Effect 3: Take Earth Back (MaleShep) Trailer.\n- Mass Effect 3: Take Earth Back (FemShep) Trailer.\n- 8 1080p HD Wallpapers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af0cb869438fcd22d659c48890bd405c3a12356","amp;dn":"Mass+Effect+Trilogy+%5B%2BAll+DLC%27s+%2BBonus+Content%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af0cb869438fcd22d659c48890bd405c3a12356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,240,203,134,148,56,252,210,45,101,156,72,137,11,212,5,195,161,35,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
