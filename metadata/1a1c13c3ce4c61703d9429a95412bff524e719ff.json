They were considered a controversial and influential band, due mostly to Morrison's cryptic lyrics and unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death on July 3, 1971, the remaining members continued as a threesome until disbanding in 1973. Despite a career that barely totaled eight years, The Doors still enjoy a huge cult following as well as status in the mainstream music industry as being hugely influential and original. According to the RIAA, they have sold over 32.5 million albums in the US alone.\n\n   Single CD version\n\n   1. &quot;Break On Through (To the Other Side)&quot; (Jim Morrison)\n   2. &quot;Light My Fire&quot;\n   3. &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot;\n   4. &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; (Jim Morrison)\n   5. &quot;People Are Strange&quot; (Jim Morrison, Robby Krieger)\n   6. &quot;Strange Days&quot;\n   7. &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;\n   8. &quot;L.A.
