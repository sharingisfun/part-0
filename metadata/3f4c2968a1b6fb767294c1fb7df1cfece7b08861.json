  "description": "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nReturn to Castle Wolfenstein (RTCW) is a sequel to the early, seminal first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D, incorporating many advances in graphics technology and gameplay design since the original game.\n\nIt features a story-based single player campaign (taking up certain themes from the original game), as well as a team-based networked multiplayer version which features different character classes that must work together in order to win. There are four classes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lieutenant, medic, engineer, and soldier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the soldier can be one of several subclasses depending upon the special/heavy weapon that he selects. Some unique weapons not found in other World War II-themed first-person shooters include the airstrike beacon, Venom, and Flame Thrower. The multiplayer demo included a beachhead assault map similar to the opening of the movie Saving Private Ryan.\n\nThe game is partially based on the 1968 movie Where Eagles Dare, where a U.S. Army Brigadier is captured and taken prisoner to the SchloÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ Adler, a fortress high in the Alps above the town of Werfen, only reachable by cable car, and the headquarters of the German Secret Service in southern Bavaria.[citation needed] The supernatural element is based on the story of Castle Wewelsburg, a 17th century castle occupied by the Germans under Heinrich Himmler's control, and used for occult rituals and practices.[citation needed]\n\nUnlike in the original Wolfenstein 3D, only a handful of the single player missions in Return to Castle Wolfenstein take place in the infamous castle/prison. The single player game takes place in Nazi-occupied Europe during 1943 and revolves around U.S. Army Ranger William &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz, who, along with another agent (Agent One ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ referred to in passing in the PC versions, and seen in the Xbox, PS2, and Mac OS X versions), is sent to investigate rumors surrounding one of Heinrich Himmler's personal projects, the SS Paranormal Division. The agents are, however, captured before completing their mission and are imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein.\nConcept art of a Loper. The strongest are encountered in X-Labs.\n\nTaking the role of Blazkowicz, the player must escape the castle and continue investigating the activities of the SS Paranormal Division, which include research on resurrecting corpses, biotechnology, and secret weapons. During the game the player will face numerous foes, including Waffen SS soldiers, elite FallschirmjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ger (paratroopers), legions of undead creatures, and horrific ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œbersoldaten (supersoldiers) formed from a hideous blend of surgery and chemical engineering conducted by Wilhelm &quot;Deathshead&quot; Strasse. The end boss is an undead Saxon warrior-prince named Heinrich I.\n\nTo make the game eligible for sale in Germany, the developers removed the Nazi swastika in Return to Castle Wolfenstein. In its stead, the German forces' logo is a creative logo that is combined from a stylized double-headed eagle (reminiscent to the eagle that was the national insignia of Nazi Germany), the Quake III Arena logo (a game previously developed by id Software and whose graphics engine that Return to Castle Wolfenstein' is based upon)and a &quot;W&quot; (standing for Wolfenstein). Every direct reference to the &quot;Third Reich&quot; was removed; thus, in that edition, the player is not battling Nazis, but a secret sect called the &quot;Wolves&quot; led by Heinrich HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ller, whose name is a pun of the original character Himmler (Himmler roughly translates as &quot;Heavener&quot;, HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ller as &quot;Heller&quot;).\n\n\nADDED FOR ERROR PLEASE READ THIS...\n\nSoryy for the missing file i have now found the problem you have to download this file and extract the EXTRA folder with the cdkey.txt file so you will get 2 folders and 1 file total\nlike this\n\nReturn To The Castle Wolfenstein and a folder you downloaded EXTRA and a file cdkey.txt just then try to install the game and it will work\n\n\nsorry for the problem as i am a new be to all these and i get these kind of problems you can download the EXTRA folder from\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?yfqwmtzwvzj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?yfqwmtzwvzj&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\ndOWNLOAD AND ENJOY\n\nPlease Do Comment As It Is Valuable To ME...\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nBy DrSAM\n",
