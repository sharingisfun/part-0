The primary revelation of Dark Side of the Moon is what a little focus does for the band. Roger Waters wrote a series of songs about mundane, everyday details which aren't that impressive by themselves, but when given the sonic backdrop of Floyd's slow, atmospheric soundscapes and carefully placed sound effects, they achieve an emotional resonance. But what gives the album true power is the subtly textured music, which evolves from ponderous, neo-psychedelic art rock to jazz fusion and blues-rock before turning back to psychedelia. It's dense with detail, but leisurely paced, creating its own dark, haunting world. Pink Floyd may have better albums than Dark Side of the Moon, but no other record defines them quite as well as this one. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa19/maxneb/pinkfloyd-album-dark_side_of_the_mo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa19/maxneb/pinkfloyd-album-dark_side_of_the_mo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TRACK LIST :.\n\n1 Speak To Me/Breathe\n2 On The Run\n3 Time\n4 The Great Gig In The Sky\n5 Money\n6 Us And Them\n7 Any Colour You Like\n8 Brain Damage\n9 Eclipse","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd3d98229f7ff854f0f9df35ec2d493f9890048","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Dark+Side+Of+The+Moon+%5BMP3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd3d98229f7ff854f0f9df35ec2d493f9890048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,211,217,130,41,247,255,133,79,15,157,243,94,194,212,147,249,137,0,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
