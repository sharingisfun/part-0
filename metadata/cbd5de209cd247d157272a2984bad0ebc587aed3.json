The quartet topped charts worldwide from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. They remain a fixture of radio playlists and continue to sell albums. The group has reportedly sold more than 370 million records, making them the sixth best-selling act after Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Michael Jackson.\n\nABBA was the first pop group from mainland Europe to enjoy consistent success in the charts of the Anglophonic world (the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand), and their enormous popularity subsequently opened the doors for other Continental European acts.\n\nABBA Gold: Greatest Hits is a compilation album by Swedish pop quartet ABBA, released in 1992. It appeared at a time when ABBA&amp;#039;s original albums had been off the market for a number of years, and was well received by the music buying public. ABBA Gold has been re-released in various &amp;#039;special&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;remastered&amp;#039; releases in 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, and including a DVD release in 2003.\n\nThe album topped the UK album chart on 4 separate occasions - in 1992, and three times in 1999 - six and a half years apart, and was the only album in the UK&amp;#039;s Top 100 sellers in every year from 1992 to 2000. It was also in the UK Top 100 Best Sellers of 2004. As a result, it is one of the highest selling and longest charting albums released in the United Kingdom. By the end of 2005, it held the 6th Most Chart Weeks of any UK album position - 352 weeks.\n\nThe original 1992 release included edited versions of &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Game.&quot; These were replaced by the full original-length versions on the 1999 and subsequent re-releases. The original 1992 version is still the only one available in the United States.\n\nThe Australasian release had a modified track list to include three local hits, replacing three other songs. In Spain, the original 1992 release replaced the English versions of &quot;Chiquitita&quot; and &quot;Fernando&quot; with the Spanish language versions.\n\nReleased September 21, 1992 \nRecorded December 1973-\nOctober 1981 \nGenre Pop \nLength 76:25 \nLabel Polygram \nProducer(s) Benny Andersson &amp; BjÃƒÂ¶rn Ulvaeus \n\nAll songs by BjÃƒÂ¶rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, unless otherwise noted.\nTRACKS:\n&quot;Dancing Queen&quot; (1976) (Anderson, Andersson, Ulvaeus) ? 3:51 \n&quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; (1977) (Anderson, Andersson, Ulvaeus) ? 4:03  \n&quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot; (1978) ? 4:06  \n&quot;Mamma Mia&quot; (1975) (Anderson, Andersson, Ulvaeus) ? 3:33  \n&quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot; (1980) ? 4:35 \n&quot;Super Trouper&quot; (1980) ? 4:13  \n&quot;I Have a Dream&quot; (1979) ? 4:42 \n&quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot; (1980) ? 4:54  \n&quot;Money, Money, Money&quot; (1976) ? 3:06 \n&quot;S.O.S&quot; (1975) (Anderson, Andersson, Ulvaeus) ? 3:20  \n&quot;Chiquitita&quot; (1979) ? 5:26  \n&quot;Fernando&quot; (1976) (Anderson, Andersson, Ulvaeus) ? 4:14 \n&quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; (1979) ? 4:21/5:10  \n&quot;Gimme!
