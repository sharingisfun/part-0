Completely clean; no add-ons, patches, cache files or configs are included (besides realmlist.wtf; running WoW.exe will generate a new config.wtf.) Feel free to use it with whatever private server you want, or patch it to a later version.\n\n\nPatched from a base 1.11 client. Using the repair utility included will only bring it as far back as 1.11.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b32e64f6cd755a9e54d60e205a9681d6670cfae","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+Client+-+Version+1.12.1+enUS+-+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b32e64f6cd755a9e54d60e205a9681d6670cfae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,50,230,79,108,215,85,169,229,77,96,226,5,169,104,29,102,112,207,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
