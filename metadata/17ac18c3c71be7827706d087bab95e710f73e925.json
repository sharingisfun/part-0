  "description": "The Secret to Success\nWritten by: Eric Thomas\nNarrated by: Charles Arrington, Eric Thomas\nLength: 5 hrs and 29 mins \nFormat: Unabridged\nRelease Date:06-26-13\nPublisher: Eric Thomas\nProgram Type: Audiobook\n\nReknowned speaker, educator, author, activist and minister, Eric Thomas is rising to national prominence by delivering a high energy message that tells youth through first hand experience how to live up to their full potential and greatness and by breaking the cycles of crime, hopelessness and despair that many face daily. Known for his engagingly personal approach, his messages are both dynamic and inspiring. When coupled with his own cycle-breaking experience, his blunt essays on reality and remarkable ability to reach even the most jaded of minds, has helped thousands of youth nationwide become peak performers academically, spiritually and personally.\nEric has electrified audiences ranging from Fortune 500 companies to urban educators, collegiate athletic programs and inner-city youth development agencies with the message of his own life's struggles and the principles, insights and strategies he used to overcome them. Eric is no stranger to the ills that plague our communities as he was born in Chicago, IL and raised on the streets of Detroit, MI. His childhood and adolescent years were difficult, and his life struggles and personal identity issues were intensified because like so many, he did not establish a relationship with his biological father until his early thirties.\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nOverall bit rate mode : Constant\nOverall bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 64.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 1 channel\nSampling rate : 22.05 KHz\n\nEncoded by : sum1 here",
