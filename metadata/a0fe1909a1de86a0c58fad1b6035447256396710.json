Gillespie, like Parker, is strong throughout, perfectly in sync with Parker on the theme statements and a consistently stimulating soloist; comping was never Monk's forte, but he delivers some quirky, if brief, solos.\n\nThe Remaster Edition features eighteen alternative and breakdown takes which make for an interesting extended coda to the six master takes which start the disc.\n\n\nCharlie Parker / Dizzy Gillespie\n\nBird and Diz\n\n1952\n\n\n  CD / 1997 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nReissue with all takes from the session:\nTracks 1 to 6 appear here in original 10&quot;-LP sequence. \nTracks 7 to 13 are complete takes. \nTracks 14, 15, 17 to 24 are breakdown takes.
