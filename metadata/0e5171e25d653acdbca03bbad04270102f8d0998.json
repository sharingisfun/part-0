  "description": "Creating hybrid mobile applications is a great way to leverage your knowledge of web languages like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Modern frameworks such as AngularJS and Ionic make it easier with pre-built templates and components. In this course, staff author Ray Villalobos shows how to install the Ionic framework and set up a development environment suitable for building web-based apps. He reviews the core Ionic components: prebuilt, easy-to-use features such as buttons, lists, tabs, and forms. Then Ray shows how to combine these components with Angular.js models, views, and controllers to build a single page app with sliders, pull-to-refresh functionality, and search. The training culminates in building a multi-page app, which youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to customize with CSS.\n\nTopics include:\nInstalling the development environment on Mac or PC\nUnderstanding the Ionic templates and CSS components\nAdding IonicIcons to a layout\nAdding tabs, cards, and lists\nUsing form elements\nBuilding a single view app\nImplementing Pull to Refresh\nCreating a multi-tab app\nStyling the applications\nDeploying applications",
