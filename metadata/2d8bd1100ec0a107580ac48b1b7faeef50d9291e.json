  "description": "StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (c) Blizzard Entertainment\n \n      07/2010 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Custom/FlashVM\n            1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Strategy\n\nSo why do you need Starcraft II? Well, 11 million Starcraft fans can't be\nwrong. The original Starcraft made its debut in 1998, and it quickly became\none of the most popular real-time strategy games of all time. Since then,\nwe've been waiting with bated breath for the sequel, which has been hinted\nat and teased since its official announcement in 2007. So why did it take\nso long? Because that is precisely how long it took to fill it with the\nperfect amount of awesome. It's a continuation of the epic struggle between\nthe human Terrans, the insect-like Zerg and the psionic Protoss. Fans of\nthe original will see some familiar faces, as well as a cast of new heroes\nas they do battle across the galaxy with veteran, upgraded and brand new\nunit types. To remain consistent with the game's new-millennium feel, the\nBattle.net gaming service has been completely revamped to offer noticeable\nenhancements and new features in multiplayer mode. The fun of Starcraft II\nis not limited to those who played the first Starcraft, however. Even if\nyou were a toddler when the first game came out, you'll be able to choose\nyour faction and jump right into the fray.\n\n2. Burn or mount the image.\n3. Install the game.
