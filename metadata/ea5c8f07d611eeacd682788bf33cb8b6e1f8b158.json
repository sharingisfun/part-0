[It] is liable to draw a large, bedazzled readership.&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ - The New York Times\n\n&quot;Like its train, the story blasts through the stagnation of these lives in suburban London and the reader cannot help but turn pages.&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ - The Boston Globe\n\n&quot;Gone Girl fans will devour this psychological thriller.&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ - People\n\nA debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people's lives.\n\nRachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She's even started to feel like she knows them. &quot;Jess and Jason,&quot;Ã‚ï¿½ she calls them. Their life - as she sees it - is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.\n\nAnd then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves on, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5c8f07d611eeacd682788bf33cb8b6e1f8b158","amp;dn":"Paula+Hawkins+-+The+Girl+on+the+Train","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5c8f07d611eeacd682788bf33cb8b6e1f8b158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,92,143,7,214,17,238,172,214,130,120,139,243,60,184,182,225,248,177,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
