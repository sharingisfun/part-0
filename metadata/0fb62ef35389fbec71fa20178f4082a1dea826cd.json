It was released by Immortal seven years later along with a DVD which I haven't seen so I can't comment on it. The recording quality on the CDs is excelent! The only thing that might bother some of you is that the sound is in mono instead of stereo. That didn't bother me at all, infact it gave a kind of warmth to the sound that made me feel like I was there at the Budokan watching the concert. The setlist is pretty similar to the officially released &quot;One More Car, One More Rider:Live On Tour 2001&quot;, but the addition of the slow version of &quot;Layla&quot;, and the removal of Billy Preston's &quot;Will It Go Round In Circles&quot; and &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; were reasons enough for me to pick this CD up. The band line-up is different as well. Billy Preston didn't play with Clapton on the Japanese leg of this tour, and was replaced with keyboardist Greg Fillenganes who's playing is very different from Billy Preston's. In my never to be humbled opinion this show should've been officially released by Reprise Records as the audio portian of &quot;One More Car, One More Rider&quot; while the Los Angeles show should've been only on the DVD. I didn't care for the way they editted the officially released CD with most of it being the L.A show, and only three songs from this Tokyo show. So if you already have both the &quot;One More Car, One More Rider&quot; CD and DVD and you think you don't need this CD for your Clapton collection I urge you to think again! Take it from an avid Clapton concert collector that each EC show is a unique listening experience, and even having multiple shows from the same tour won't get repetitive or redundant. So pick this CD up, crank it up, and enjoy! Thanks for reading. I hope this was somewhat helpful.
