What is dream? What is reality? What is fantasy? What is sanity? What is madness?\n\nSuch questions pervade &quot;Open Your Eyes,&quot; a psychological thriller directed by Alejandro Amenabar. &quot;Open Your Eyes,&quot; which darts among such relative novelties as virtual reality and cryogenics, is at bottom a retelling of the story of Job for a vain, materialistic, selfish age.\n\nHandsomely filmed in Madrid with an attractive cast, this Spanish feature is unlikely to satisfy those who insist on linear storytelling and pat endings. But in its deliberately vexing way, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; is a film with enough intellectual meat on its stylish bones to give more adventurous moviegoers something to chew on afterward. [/QUOTE]\n\n[SPOILER] Its protagonist is Cesar (Eduardo Noriega), a good-looking, 25-year-old successful businessman with a well-appointed apartment, three cars and a reputation for never spending two nights with the same woman.\n\nHe is about to lose all he values.\n\nAt the outset of &quot;Open Your Eyes,&quot; he would like to rid himself of his latest conquest, Nuria (Najwa Nimri), and when she appears uninvited at his birthday party, Cesar enlists Sofia (Penelope Cruz), the date of his best friend, Pelayo (Fele Martinez), in his effort to avoid her.\n\nCesar's attention to the beautiful Sofia is less than innocent. He takes her home; they are mutually attracted, although they do not sleep together. When he leaves the next morning, Nuria is waiting in her car to tempt him. He wavers momentarily, then accepts her invitation. He declines the pills she offers. She downs them, floors the accelerator and sends the speeding car hurtling off the road, down an incline and into a stone wall.\n\nCesar awakes horribly disfigured, behind a mask, under interrogation by a psychiatrist inside a cell where he is imprisoned on a murder charge.\n\nFrom then on &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; plays games with the minds of Cesar and its audience. Having taken away his looks and Sofia, the woman he might actually have loved, the film, like a fairy tale, brings her back into his life and then, miraculously, restores his ruined face.\n\nThe film also restores the dead Nuria and turns its attention intermittently to the mysterious Serge Duvernois (Gerard Barray), who appears on television talking about cryogenics and the possibility of life after death.\n\nBut as the psychiatrist, Antonio (Chete Lera), tries to find out what caused Cesar to commit a murder, there is Cesar speaking behind the mask that conceals his still-ravaged face.\n\nThe film's framing device is a talking alarm clock that starts Cesar's day with the message &quot;Open Your Eyes.&quot;\n\nIs Cesar's life a dream or a nightmare?
