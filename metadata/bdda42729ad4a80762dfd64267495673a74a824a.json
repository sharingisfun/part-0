With songs like the debut single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a Lie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Standing in the Sun,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“No More Heroes,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad Rain,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the riveting ballad, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not for Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ voice, lyric and axe form a holy performance trinity of extraordinary passion, power and authenticity. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not For MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ might be my favorite track on the record, a labor of love and retrospection,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ confesses the vocal acrobat. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The lyrics stem from conversations I had with Slash regarding some of his bad behavior from way back, combined with things that I lived through. I went through a pretty dark period about 12 years ago, experimenting with things I probably should have avoided that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really work for me. That song is about waking up and having this epiphany that things needed to change and it was time to take a different route in life. I think thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something a lot of people, not just artists or rock stars, go through under different circumstances. It could be anything thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not working, a mindset, habit, pattern or relationship.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½",
