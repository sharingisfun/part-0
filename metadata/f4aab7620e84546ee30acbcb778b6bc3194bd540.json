They're 11, and both want to play in the NBA, just like Quincy's dad. Their love-hate relationship lasts into high school, with Monica's edge and Quincy's top-dog attitude separating them, except when Quincy's parents argue and he climbs through Monica's window to sleep on the floor. As high school ends, they come together as a couple, but within a year, with both of them playing ball at USC, Quincy's relationship with his father takes an ugly turn, and it leads to a break up with Monica. Some years later, their pro careers at a crossroads, they meet again. It's time for a final game of one-on-one with high stakes. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4aab7620e84546ee30acbcb778b6bc3194bd540","amp;dn":"Love+%26amp%3B+Basketball+%282000%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4aab7620e84546ee30acbcb778b6bc3194bd540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,170,183,98,14,132,84,110,227,10,203,203,119,139,107,195,25,75,213,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
