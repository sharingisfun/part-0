Thanks to automatic partition alignment** you can always get top performance out of SSDs and hard disks with 4-K sectors and RAID volumes.\r\n\r\nParagon Recovery Medium\r\nIf your operating system wonâ€™t boot up anymore, you can fire up your PC with the bootable Paragon recovery environment and load in an existing backup, secure important data or rectify booting errors.

And thanks to the latest WinPE technology, the recovery environment is also intuitive to operate.\r\n\r\nAre your backups on a network drive? Then use the advanced options and already add your network configuration and network drive while youâ€™re still creating the recovery medium.\r\n\r\nHave you got a new PC or version of Windows?
