  "description": "Minecraft - Pocket Edition v0.10.4\nRequirements: 3.0+\nOverview: Minecraft is about placing blocks to build things and going on adventures!\n\n[break]\nPocket Edition includes randomly generated worlds, multiplayer over a local Wi-Fi network, and Survival and Creative modes. You can craft and create with your friends anywhere in the world so long as you have hands spare and battery to burn.\nOur most recent update added the iconic Creepers. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re big, green, mean and explody. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one of many. Since Minecraft Ã¢â‚¬â€ Pocket Edition first appeared, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re continuing to add loads of new features, including...\n- Food! Now you can cook and go hungry\n- Swords! Bows! TNT!\n- Chests\n- Skeletons\n- Spiders\n- Beds\n- Paintings\n- Lots more!\nBut enough sales talk! Download it already! And have fun!\n\nWhat's New\n0.10 - Prettier, faster, less buggier\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve improved the graphics, increased performance, and killed off heaps of bugs in one massive update. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also stopped baby animals from sinking when they try to swim because thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just mean. Update and have fun!\n- Loads of bug fixes!\n- More watery-looking water\n- Foggier-looking fog\n- Even more particles than before\n- Tinted lighting on terrain and mobs\n- Improved performance on many devices\n- More fences! More fence gates! Everyone loves fences\n\nThis app has NO advertisements",
