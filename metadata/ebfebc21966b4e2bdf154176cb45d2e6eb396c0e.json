Traveling teacher Aesculapius arranges for the inquisitive daughter Johanna to be enrolled too, against their father's wishes. Unfit for the boys-only dorm, she gets to stay with count Gerold, incurring his wife's due jealousy. She's to be dismissed, but survives a Viking pillaging slaughter and assumes brother Johannes's identity to join a monastery, where she becomes the infirmary's trainee. Fleeing exposure as female, she arrives in Rome. As a protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©e of rivals in the viper nest-like papal court, she ends up elected as pope, but carries count Gerold's baby, guaranteeing exposure. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebfebc21966b4e2bdf154176cb45d2e6eb396c0e","amp;dn":"Pope+Joan+%282009%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebfebc21966b4e2bdf154176cb45d2e6eb396c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,254,188,33,150,107,78,43,223,21,65,118,203,69,210,230,235,57,108,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
