  "description": "Plastic Ono Band is the debut solo album by English rock musician John Lennon. It was released in 1970, after Lennon had issued three experimental albums with Yoko Ono and Live Peace in Toronto 1969, a live performance in Toronto credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The album was recorded simultaneously with Ono's debut avant garde solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, at Ascot Sound Studios and Abbey Road Studios using the same musicians and production team, and featured nearly identical cover artwork. John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band is generally considered one of Lennon's finest solo albums, documenting with honesty and artistic integrity his emotional and mental state at that point in his career. In 1987, as part of its 20th anniversary, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it fourth on &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years&quot;. In 2012, the magazine ranked it number 23 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nTrack Listing **** 2010 Remaster **** [320k MP3]\n\n    \n    &quot;Mother&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:34\n    &quot;Hold On&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:52\n    &quot;I Found Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48\n    &quot;Isolation&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:51\n    &quot;Remember&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:33\n    &quot;Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:21\n    &quot;Well Well Well&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:59\n    &quot;Look at Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:53\n    &quot;God&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:09\n    &quot;My Mummy's Dead&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:49\n\n\n**** The John Lennon Signature Box is an 11-disc box set of remastered John Lennon albums and new collections, released on CD and digital format, as part of the &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; collection.
