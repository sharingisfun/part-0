  "description": "Josh Groban\nStages (Deluxe Edition) (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nJosh Groban is among the most popular singers straddling the classical and pop genres. It can be said his voice does some straddling as well, ranging from upper baritone well into the tenor range, making classification somewhat problematic. What is not problematic for the listener is the warm, mellifluous sound produced by it, the chief reason for Groban's meteoric rise. As a first-semester music theater student at Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, Groban left with the offer of a major recording contract and soon began appearing in concert with Sarah Brightman, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, and other vocal superstars. His first solo album, the eponymously titled Josh Groban, was released in 2001 and was an instant hit, auguring international stardom. Groban has made numerous television appearances, including on Oprah, Good Morning America, Today, two PBS specials, the 2004 Superbowl pregame ceremonies, two Ally McBeal episodes (2002-2003), and on the BBC. He has had a number of gold and platinum recordings, mostly for the various Warner Bros. labels (Atlantic, 143 Records, WEA/Reprise, etc.). \n\n\nGenre................: Vocal Pop\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker\n\n\n\n01.Pure Imagination (Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory)\n02.What I Did For Love (A Chorus Line)\n03.Bring Him Home (Les MisÃƒÂ©rables)\n04.Les Temps Des CathÃƒÂ©drales (Notre-Dame De Paris)\n05.All I Ask Of You (Feat.
