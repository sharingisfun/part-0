  "description": "\n\nDanko Jones is a Canadian rock band from Toronto, Canada. The band consists of Danko Jones (vocals/guitar), John 'JC' Calabrese (bass guitar) and Rich Knox (drums).\n\nFormed in 1996,they played consistently for two years in and around the northeastern United States and Canada, opening for The New Bomb Turks, Nashville Pussy, Blonde Redhead, The Make-Up, The Dirtbombs, The Chrome Cranks and The Demolition Doll Rods. Originally they did not even want to release an album opting to have the band's live reputation spread via word of mouth.\n\nEventually, the trio relented and put out a self-titled six song e.p. on Sonic Unyon records in 1998. In 1999 they released the self-produced My Love Is Bold E.P. and achieved national exposure with the single &quot;Bounce&quot;.They were nominated for a Juno Award in 2000 for Best Alternative Album.\n\nIn 2001 Bad Taste Records released a compilation of the band's early recordings, demos, and b-sides entitled, I'm Alive and On Fire. A 5 week European tour followed to promote the release including shows at the Roskilde festival in Denmark and Hultsfred festival in Sweden. By the end of the year they had returned 2 more times, most notably as main support for the Backyard Babies.\n\nimage\n\nBand Members\n\nDanko Jones - guitars, vocals\nAtom Willard - drums\nJohn Calabrese - bass\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nBorn a Lion (2002)\nWe Sweat Blood (2003)\nSleep Is the Enemy (2006)\nNever Too Loud (2008)\nBelow the Belt (2010)\nRock and Roll Is Black and Blue (2012)\nFire Music (2015)\n\n\n\nFire Music (2015)\n\n\n\n1.
