  "description": "How do you define a graphic novel? If you take the term in its literal sense, then youâ€™re looking at single, selfcontained stories, rather than collected serials and ongoing comics. And that would discount most of your favourites. No Dark Knight Returns, no V For Vendetta (both originally serialised), no Love And Rockets (an ongoing title)â€¦ Clearly, we werenâ€™t going to go down that route with this list. Instead, this is a selection of our 100 favourite graphic novels, ongoing comics, collected editions and individual volumes of larger series in all genres. Itâ€™s a broad slate of titles that we think are essential reading, from super-hero classics to the smartest indies. Itâ€™s a diverse list where each book has only one thing in common: theyâ€™re all really, really good. Are there gaps? Oh, for sure! There are way more than 100 great comics out there and weâ€™ve tried not to lean too hard on specific creators (thereâ€™s more than a little Alan Moore and Grant Morrison here, but they both could have been far more dominant). But I hope youâ€™ll find something cool and new that you want to try as well as a selection of your old favourites.\r\n\r\nThe 100 Greatest Graphic Novels Of All Time\r\nEnglish | 112 pages | PDF | 43.39 MB",
