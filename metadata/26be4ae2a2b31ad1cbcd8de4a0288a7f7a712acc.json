  "description": "Turn Blue is the eighth studio album by American rock duo the Black Keys. It was co-produced by Danger Mouse and the band, and was released on Nonesuch Records on May 12, 2014. The record was the group's fourth collaboration with Danger Mouse, following their previous studio album, El Camino (2011), which was their biggest commercial and critical success to that point. For Turn Blue, Danger Mouse reprised his role from El Camino as an equal songwriting partner alongside guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney.\n\nThe Black Keys recorded the majority of Turn Blue at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California, from JulyÃ¢â‚¬â€œAugust 2013, with additional recording taking place at Key Club in Benton Harbor, Michigan, and Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, in early 2014. The sessions coincided with Auerbach's divorce from his wife, which inspired much of the album's lyrics. The resulting material was more melancholy and slower paced than the uptempo, hook-laden songs from El Camino. The album exhibits influences from psychedelic rock and soul, further departing from the raw, blues-rock sound of the group's early years. In addition to representing the record's moody tone, the title was selected as a homage to the &quot;turn blue&quot; catchphrase used by 1960s horror host Ghoulardi.\n\nThe band announced the album in March 2014 via a tweet by retired boxer Mike Tyson and a series of cryptic YouTube videos featuring a hypnotist. The song &quot;Fever&quot; was released as the lead single in March. Turn Blue has received favorable reviews from critics, many of whom commented on Danger Mouse's growing influence on the band. The album debuted at number one in the United States and Australia, becoming the group's first record to top the charts in either country. In May 2014, they embarked on a world tour in support of the album.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Weight of Love&quot;   \t6:50\n02. \t&quot;In Time&quot;   \t4:28\n03. \t&quot;Turn Blue&quot;   \t3:42\n04. \t&quot;Fever&quot;   \t4:06\n05. \t&quot;Year in Review&quot;   \t3:48\n06. \t&quot;Bullet in the Brain&quot;   \t4:15\n07. \t&quot;It's Up to You Now&quot;   \t3:10\n08. \t&quot;Waiting on Words&quot;   \t3:37\n09. \t&quot;10 Lovers&quot;   \t3:33\n10. \t&quot;In Our Prime&quot;   \t4:38\n11. \t&quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;   \t3:02\n",
