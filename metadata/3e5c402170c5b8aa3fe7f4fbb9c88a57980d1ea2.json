Operations were completed in one month\nthanks to Britannia's deployment of new mobile humanoid armor vehicles dubbed Knightmare Frames.\nJapan's rights and identity were stripped away, the once proud nation now referred to as Area 11.\nIts citizens, Elevens, are forced to scratch out a living while the Britannian aristocracy\nlives comfortably within their settlements. Pockets of resistance appear throughout Area 11,\nworking towards independence for Japan.\nLelouch, an exiled Imperial Prince of Britannia posing as a student, finds himself in the\nheart of the ongoing conflict for the island nation. Through a chance meeting with a\nmysterious girl named C.C., Lelouch gains his Geass, the power of the king.\nNow endowed with absolute dominance over any person,\nLelouch may finally realize his goal of bringing down Britannia from within!\n\n\nIMDB :- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0994314/( Rating : 8.7 )[/i]\n\nPlease KEEEEEP SEEEEEDING !!\n\nCheers !!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e5c402170c5b8aa3fe7f4fbb9c88a57980d1ea2","amp;dn":"Code+Geass+Complete+Series+R1+%2C+R2+%5BEng+Sub%5D+%5B480p%5D+L%40mBerT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e5c402170c5b8aa3fe7f4fbb9c88a57980d1ea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,92,64,33,112,197,184,170,63,231,244,251,185,200,138,87,152,13,30,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
