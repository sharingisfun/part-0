  "description": "As members of the Beast Coast movement (which includes Joey Bada$$ and his Pro Era crew), The Underachievers are part of the new wave of rappers that have been coming out of New York. But theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also repping the West: last summer the duo signed to Flying LotusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ label in LA, Brainfeeder. Ã¢â‚¬ËœIndigoismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ marks the first Brainfeeder/Underachievers collaboration. Dropping February 1st, the 17-track mixtape features the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underground hits (including Ã¢â‚¬ËœGold Soul Theory,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœHerb ShuttlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœLeopard ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), in addition to brand new tracks produced by the likes of Mr Bristol, Rich Flyer, The Entreproducers, Bruce Lee Kixxs, Juice and Lou Chapo from Tribe Gang, and Dreamrite. Listening to their sage lyrics, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to believe theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re only 21 (Ak) and 22 (Issa Dash) years old. And on the strength of Ã¢â‚¬ËœIndigoism,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s near impossible to believe that up until 9 months ago, Ak and Dash had no set intention to be in the rap game at all. As they say themselves: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Indigos on the rise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n1.Philanthropist (Prod. Blacktophero) \n2.Revelations (Prod. Lou The Human (Tribe Gang) \n3.So Devilish (Prod.
