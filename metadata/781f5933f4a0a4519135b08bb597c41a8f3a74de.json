  "description": "NOTE: This will NOT activate Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2, or Microsoft Office 2013 on those Operating Systems!\n\nThis is a set of tools and functions for managing licensing, deploying, and activating Microsoft Office and Windows. All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as they could conflict or cause damage if run concurrently. The Microsoft Office Setup Customization Functions (Customize Setup Tab), AutoKMS Uninstaller (if AutoKMS is installed), AutoRearm Uninstaller (if AutoRearm is installed), Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Microsoft Office or Windows is not installed/supported. For information about individual functions, see the program readme.\n\nRequirements:\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.0 or 4.5 (Not 3.5)\nMicrosoft Office 2010 or Later for Office Toolkit Support \nWindows Vista or Later for Windows Toolkit Support\n\nMicrosoft Toolkit Changelog: \n\n2.4.9\n-Activation won't crash if attempting to activate KMS V6 clients (which currently can't be activated).\n-EZ-Activator will attempt to install Windows Embedded Volume Keys (such as Windows Thin PC).\n-License Backup and Restore supported for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.\n-Updated functionality and inclusion of Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 RTM Keys.\n\nredits:\n-Bosh for the original GUI Design and co-development of Office Toolkit\n-ZWT for the original KMSEmulator\n-letsgoawayhell, Phazor, nosferati87, and mikmik38 for KMSEmulator fixes and improvements\n-MasterDisaster, FreeStyler, Daz, nononsense, and janek2012 for work on Key Checker\n\nDownloads:\n2.4.9\nEXE MD5*: 93C754BB404E8B488B50920D65CE9B80\n\nIf you ask me about 8.1 or 2012r2, I will just give you the stink-eye behind my screen. I will not respond to you. It won't work until they crack the v6 KMS activation. That is likely weeks or months off.\n\nmurphy78 TPB/MDL",
