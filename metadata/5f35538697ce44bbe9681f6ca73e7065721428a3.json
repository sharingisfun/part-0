  "description": "Product Overview\n================\n\n\nPhoenix FD is a powerful tool for fluid simulations. Aimed to meet the needs of VFX artist to simulate fire, smoke, explosions as well as liquids, foam and splashes, it has now become universal simulation software for every production house. Phoenix FD offers exceptional flexibility and speed. With an adaptive grid, complete interactivity, a GPU accelerated preview and a fully multi-threaded displacement algorithm it stands out as one of the top solutions for fluid simulations in the visual effects industry.\n\nPhoenix FD 2.0 now adds the capability to generate and drag particles based on current simulations. This allows the user to add even finer detail to all types of simulations without the need to increase the simulation resolution.\n\n\nPhoenix FD 2.0 for 3ds Max Key Features\n=======================================\n\n\nFoam and splashes particle shader\n---------------------------------\nPhoenix FD 2.0 comes with a brand new shader for particles. It allows the user to have full control when shading foam and splashes particles generated by the new core.\n\n\nSimulation of foam and splashes\n-------------------------------\nWith the new and improved simulation core, Phoenix FD is capable of generating particles where foam or splashes would usually appear in a simulation. This extraordinary new technology allows the user to further increase the realism of liquid simulations.\n\n\nGPU Preview improvements\n------------------------\nIn version 2.0 the GPU preview fully supports lighting and diffuse color shading. Additionally, the renderings can be automatically saved as PNG files in the simulation directory. This seemingly simple upgrade will allow the user to quickly preview their simulation results without having to waste time rendering them on the CPU.\n\n\nRender particles as smoke\n-------------------------\nNew and improved shading methods allow the rendering of small tightly packed particles as a volumetric smoke. This simple yet powerful solution allows the user to add plenty of detail to their simulations without sacrificing render times.\n\n\nParticle export\n---------------\nThe simulation core has been further improved to be able to efficiently trace particles. This allows the user to add even finer detail to all types of simulations without the need to increase the simulation resolution..\n\n\nSystem requirements\n-------------------\nMicrosoft Windows XP Professional (SP2 or higher) 32-bit or 64-bit\nMicrosoft Windows Vista Business (SP1 or higher) 32-bit or 64-bit\nMicrosoft Windows 7 32-bit or 64-bit\nMicrosoft Windows 8 32-bit or 64-bit\nMinimum 2GHz CPU\nMinimum 1GB RAM\n\n\nSupported platforms\n===================\n\nCurrently supports 3ds Max platforms:\n-------------------------------------\n\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2014\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2013\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2012\nAutodesk 3ds Max Design 2011\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2011\nAutodesk 3ds Max Design 2010\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2010\nAutodesk 3ds Max Design 2009\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2009\nAutodesk 3ds Max 2008\nAutodesk 3ds Max 9",
