The warrior who defeated Diablo, thinking he could contain \nthe demon, thrust the crystal into his own skull. Yet the overwhelming fury of the arch-demon, combined \nwith the warrior's fatigue, was more than enough to overpower the helpless man. Diablo immediately \ntwisted the once proud warrior's body into a walking nightmare--you must now stop this new threat.\n \nBy some, the first game in the Diablo series was considered limited, containing only three character \nclasses, one town, and a single set of dungeons, catacombs, and twisted crypts to explore. Well, even \nthe most jaded gamers won't find the same problem in Diablo II. Featuring five unique classes, several \ntowns, and dungeons enough to fill four compact discs, this game is huge. Containing the massive assortment \nof weapons and armor used to wage war upon the undead in the first game--and adding loads more--you won't \nrun up against a shortage of ways to mutilate, massacre, and utterly destroy your competition.\n \nOnce again, this newest Blizzard release includes free internet play on the company's Battle.net internet \ngaming service. But, as cheating was most likely the worst problem with playing Diablo on Battle.net, the \nteam working on the sequel has taken great pains in redesigning the entire game engine from the ground up \nto eliminate the frustration in fighting unbeatable opponents. ~ Chris Couper, All Game Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Diablo II Expansion Set: Lord of Destruction\n     \n\n Developed by Blizzard North - Blizzard Entertainment (2002) - Isometric Action RPG - Rated Mature\n\n\nThis expansion pack for Blizzard's well received Diablo II adds to nearly every aspect of the original \nrelease. In addition to the five classes offered in the basic game, the expansion allows play as a Druid \nor an Assassin, each with his or her own unique skill ladder. There are also new monsters to fight, some \nwith all new styles of attack. There's more to collect in the expanded game as well, with thousands of new \nweapons and magic items, plus more room to keep them in a larger player &quot;stash.&quot; Finally, the expansion \nincludes one whole new Act, set in the Barbarian lands, to provide players with new NPC's to meet and quests \nto fulfill. Like all expansion packs, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction requires a full installation of the main \ngame, Diablo II. ~ T.J.
