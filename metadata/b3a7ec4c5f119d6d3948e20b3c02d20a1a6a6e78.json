  "description": "Pooles - Recipes and Stories from a Modern Diner (2016) (Epub) Gooner\r\n\r\nPublisher: Ten Speed Press (September 20, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1607746875\r\nISBN-13: 978-1607746874\r\n\r\nFrom the acclaimed chef Ashley Christensen comes a bold and revelatory reinvention of Southern food, as told through the recipes and stories from her iconic and beloved restaurant, Poole's Diner.  \r\n\r\nAshley Christensen is the new face of Southern cooking, and her debut cookbook, Poole's, honors the traditions of this celebrated cuisine, while introducing a new vernacularâ€”elevated simple side dishes spiked with complex vinaigrettes, meatless mains showcasing vibrant vegetables, and intensified flavors through a cadre of back-pocket recipes that will become indispensable in your kitchen. Recipes like Turnip Green Fritters with Whipped Tahini; Heirloom Tomatoes with Crushed Olives, Crispy Quinoa, and White Anchovy Dressing; and Warm Broccoli Salad with Cheddar and Bacon Vinaigrette share the menu with the definitive recipe for Pimento Cheese, a show-stopping Macaroni au Gratin, and crave-worthy Challah Bread Pudding with Whiskey Apples and Creme Fraiche, all redefining what comfort food can be.\r\n\r\nPoole's is also the story of how Christensen opened a restaurant, and in the process, energized Raleigh's downtown. By fostering a network of farmers, cooks, and guests, and taking care of her people by feeding them well, she built a powerful community around the restaurant. The cookbook is infused with Christensen's generous spirit and belief that great cooking is fundamental to good living.\r\n\r\nWith abundant, dramatically beautiful photography and a luxe presentation, Poole's is a landmark addition to the cookbook canon, a collection from which readers will cook and find inspiration, and pass down for generations to come",
