Whether your on a small laptop or a networked server with multiple CPUs, KeyShot will use all the cores available.\n\nPowerful Animation - The KeyShot Animation system is a new streamlined approach to quickly creating fluid product animations with real-time update and playback to see it all as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s created.\n\nAdvanced features - KeyShot Pro level features deliver advanced capabilities that deal directly with product development workflow and conceptualization for ultimate visual satisfaction.\n\nHow itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different \n\nKeyShot is widely recognized as the easiest and most powerful rendering and animation software when it comes to selling a concept, internal presentations, digital prototyping, and creating sales or marketing images Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all from your 3D data. \n\nFast - Everything inside KeyShot happens in realtime. KeyShot uses unique rendering technology which makes it possible to see all changes to materials, lighting, and cameras instantly. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to hit the render button and wait for minutes or hours to wait for the results. As soon as you assign a material to a part, you will see the change immediately. \n\nEasy - You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be a rendering expert to create photorealistic images of your 3D model. Simply import your data into KeyShot, assign materials by dragging and dropping them onto the model, adjust the lighting, and move the camera. Done. You see everything happen instantly right in front of you. Learning KeyShot literally takes only a few minutes. \n\nAccurate - KeyShot is the most accurate rendering solution for your 3D data. KeyShot is built on LuxionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internally developed, physically correct render engine based on research in the areas of scientifically accurate material representation and global illumination. The result is stunning realism, incredible accuracy and speed that is beyond compare. \n\nPowerful Architecture - KeyShot doesnÃŠÂ¼t require any special hardware or graphics card. KeyShot takes full advantage of all cores and threads inside a computer. As your computer gets more powerful KeyShot becomes faster. The performance scales linearly with the number of cores and threads in your system. If you double the amount of cores, you double performance and cut render time in half. \n\nTight Integration - KeyShot is tightly integrated with your 3D data. When you import 3D geometry, KeyShot maintains the entire model structure including part and assembly names. Changes made to your model in 3D can import back into KeyShot without having to reassign materials or lighting. In addition, KeyShot can also be accessed directly from within many 3D software packages through a plugin. \n\nLarge Data Sets - Since KeyShot is CPU based, any imported data is stored in RAM Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not the video card. This allows KeyShot to handle extremely large data sets. There are no restrictions on the size of the data set as long as the computer has enough memory available. KeyShot is highly optimized which makes it possible to work with models with tens of millions of polygons even on a laptop. \n\nAnimation\n\nKeyShot revolutionary new animation system brings a whole new level of creating animations quickly and easily to your product development pipeline. KeyShot doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rely on inserting and managing keyframes. Instead, apply individual transforms (rotations, translations, etc.) to set up new animations with a click of button, and update materials and lighting as the animation plays\n\nKeyShotVRTM\n\nKeyShotVR is a patent-pending technology that brings the advantage of interactive 3D-enabled viewing via desktop, laptop or mobile device to produce portfolios, presentations and collateral for design reviews. Product designers, marketers and KeyShot users who want to extend the presentation of their visuals are able to create the high-quality, ray-traced 3D content directly from inside KeyShot\n\n64-bit architecture - 64 bit architecture1 FeaturesKeyShot is built on 64-bit architecture giving you the power and ability to utilize more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory with any modern 64-bit system. KeyShot is cross-platform compatibly and can be used on both Microsoft Windows and Apple computers. \n\nInteractive Labeling - Labels are designed for easy placement of logos, stickers or images that need to be placed freely onto a 3D model. Common image formats are supported such as jpg, tiff, tga, and png. Multiple labels can be added to a material and each label has its own mapping type. Images with transparency are supported as well. \n\nRender Queue - The render queue is used to batch process image and animation rendering. You can simply add an image or animation Ã¢â‚¬Å“jobÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the queue from various files throughout the day, then click the Ã¢â‚¬Å“process queueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ button to start the queue rendering. Each job records the state of the scene and all render settings. The system can be left for the night to process the jobs. \n\nLive Linking - Live linking allows seamless model updates between the modeling software and KeyShot, without having to reassign materials, set up animations again, or update settings. Transfer your design from PTC Creo, SolidWorks, or Rhino to KeyShot. Assign materials and animations, continue modeling and push over changes to KeyShot. Changed parts will be replace and updated with the new parts and all materials and animations will be maintained. \n\nCPU-Powered - keyshot cpu rendering FeaturesKeyShot is 100% CPU-Powered. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need any special hardware or graphics card. KeyShot takes full advantage of all cores and threads inside a computer. As your computer gets more powerful, KeyShot becomes faster. The performance scales linearly with the number of cores and threads in your system. \n\nBump-mapping - Bump maps are images used to create fine details in materials that would be unrealistic to build into the model. Brushed metals and textured plastics are easily created using bump maps. Any common format color or grayscale image can be used as a bump map. With these images the bright and dark areas are interpreted as high and low spots on the surface. \n\nNetwork Rendering - The network rendering system allows you to take advantage of multiple systems for rendering images and animations. After the simple installation process, any user with KeyShot can send a Ã¢â‚¬Å“jobÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to be rendered on the network. The jobs are organized into a queue that all users can view. Jobs can also be sent from the internal KeyShot queue to network rendering.\n\nImport options - With over 20 supported 3D file formats, KeyShot imports the largest number of file types of any 3D rendering software. Along with being able to handle large data sets and different file types, KeyShot provides options to make sure your data is imported accurately and ready to apply materials. With plugins for 3ds Max, PTC Creo, Pro/ENGINEER, Rhinoceros, SolidWorks and SketchUp, import capabilities are extended even further.\n\nWhat is new ==&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.keyshot.com/whats-new/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.keyshot.com/whats-new/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n-INTEL Pentium 4 processor or AMD or better\n-Windows 7 64 bit or Windows 8 64 bit or later\n-OpenGL 2.x or higher\n-Minimum 2GB of RAM\n-Minimum 2GB hard disk space\n-3 button mouse\n-Monitor resolution of 1024 X 768 or greater\n\nLanguage : Multilanguage\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.keyshot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.keyshot.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1690350bfcca1be0aae38ac0c8ff22691afbcb30","amp;dn":"Luxion+KeyShot+Pro+5.0.97+%2864+bit%29%2BAnimation%2BKeyShotVR+%5BChingLiu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1690350bfcca1be0aae38ac0c8ff22691afbcb30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,144,53,11,252,202,27,224,170,227,138,192,200,255,34,105,26,251,203,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
