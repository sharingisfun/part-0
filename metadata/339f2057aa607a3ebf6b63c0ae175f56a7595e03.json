The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old &quot;human error&quot; are much more likely to kill him first.\n\nBut Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skillsÃ¢â‚¬â€and a relentless, dogged refusal to quitÃ¢â‚¬â€he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:339f2057aa607a3ebf6b63c0ae175f56a7595e03","amp;dn":"The+Martian+-+Andy+Weir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"339f2057aa607a3ebf6b63c0ae175f56a7595e03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,159,32,87,170,96,122,62,191,107,99,192,174,23,95,86,167,89,94,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
