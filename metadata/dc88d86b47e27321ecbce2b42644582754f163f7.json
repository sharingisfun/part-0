  "description": "\nPublisher: Laurence King Publishing (February 9, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1780677294\r\nISBN-13: 978-1780677293\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Have Great Ideas is the essential guide for students and young professionals looking to embrace creative thinking in design, advertising and communications. It provides 53 practical strategies for unlocking innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nStrategies include improvisation techniques, changing the scenery, finding hidden links, looking to nature for inspiration, combining unusual systems, challenging set boundaries and many more. Each strategy is packed with great examples of successful contemporary and historical designs â€“ from a designer dress made out of old converse trainers to ticket machines powered by recycled bottles in China, via the reimagining of famous brand logos and mis-use of photocopiers.\r\n\r\nPacked with practical projects to kick-start inventive thought in idea-blocked moments, this book explores creative thinking across all visual arts disciplines",
