All that changes when a massive particle accelerator accident leads to Barry being struck by lightning in his lab. Coming out of coma nine months later, Barry and his new friends at S.T.A.R labs find that he now has the ability to move at superhuman speed. Furthermore, Barry learns that he is but one of many affected by that event, most of whom are using their powers for evil. Determined to make a difference, Barry dedicates his life to fighting such threats, as The Flash. While he gains allies he never expected, there are also secret forces determined to aid and manipulate him for their own agenda.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS:  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/kC2nhnr.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/tccwtJ2.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZHQ6Fm8.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/hsMhvrr.jpg\r\n\r\n###SUBS ARE MUXED WITHIN THE FILES###\r\n(YOU CAN ENABLE or DISABLE AS PER YOUR REQUIREMENT)\r\n\r\n***PLEASE SEED BACK FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN***\r\n\r\nUSE THE LATEST VERSION OF K-LITE OR CCCP FOR THE BEST PLAYBACK\r\n(WANNA STICK WITH VLC?
