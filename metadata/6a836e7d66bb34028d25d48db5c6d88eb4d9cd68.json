This thorough update of a classic book, regarded as both an excellent overview and an important piece of scholarship, includes fully revised content, new sections on the use of horses, handguns, incendiary weapons, and siege engines, and eighteen new illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe four key organizing sections of the book still remain: arms and armor, artillery, fortifications, and warships. Throughout, the authors connect these technologies to broader themes and developments in medieval society as well as to current scholarly and curatorial controversies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a836e7d66bb34028d25d48db5c6d88eb4d9cd68","amp;dn":"Medieval+Military+Technology%2C+2nd+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a836e7d66bb34028d25d48db5c6d88eb4d9cd68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,131,110,125,102,187,52,2,141,37,212,141,181,198,216,142,180,217,205,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
