He released his first hit song, &quot;Piano Man&quot;, in 1973. According to the RIAA, Billy Joel is the sixth best-selling recording artist in the United States.\nJoel had Top 10 hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and has 33 Top 40 hits in the United States overall. He is also a five-time Grammy Award winner, a 23-time Grammy nominee and has sold in excess of 150 million albums worldwide. He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). Joel &quot;retired&quot; from recording pop music in 1993 but continued to tour (sometimes with Elton John). In 2001, he released Fantasies &amp; Delusions, a CD of classical compositions for piano. In 2007, he briefly returned to pop songwriting and recording with a single entitled &quot;All My Life&quot; written for his third wife Katie Lee Joel. Joel returned to touring in 2006 after a three-year hiatus from the road and has toured extensively ever since, covering many major world cities. In March 2009, Joel resumed his popular Face to Face tour with fellow piano man Elton John. Concerts are scheduled to be held sporadically over two years and travel around the world.
