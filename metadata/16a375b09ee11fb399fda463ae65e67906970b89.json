  "description": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 Proper-RELOADED\nPro Evolution Soccer 2013 Proper (c) Konami\n\n09/2012 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom  Serial\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Sports\n\nNote: Besides using the usual cheap Securom hack, SKIDROWs release crashes\nFor instance when starting a match. We could point out that the crash is due\nto a broken data file (imgdt07.img). We could also point out that this file\nis also broken on a version of this game out on p2p. We could even point out\nthat the files are identical. But it seems a bit pointless when they get\naway with this week after week. The practice appears to be as systematic as\ntheir denial of it. And other groups and siteops implicitly accepts it\nWe don't know if this says more about them, or the scene. Cheers\n\nKick off for thrilling soccer matches on the pitch with PES 2013: Pro\nEvolution Soccer. Experience the excitement and heart-racing action of the\nworld's most popular sport on your PlayStation 3. Jump onto the pitch and\ncompete against some of the top players in the sport thanks to the\ninclusion of the UEFA Champion's League and Copa Santander Libertadores\nVie for glory against many of soccer's prolific personalities with the\nlifelike player models that have been upgraded to feature movements to\nappear more like the real-life players. Dribble and pass with more freedom\nthan ever, and go up against top goalkeepers that are more true-to-life\nthan ever before with improved animations, logic and responses. Take\nadvantage of precise offensive and defensive controls to fire electric\nshots, execute pinpoint passes or to sway the momentum with strategic\ndefensive stops and turnovers. Connect to and interact with other players\nthanks to the enhanced MyPES platform that links all online and offline\ngamers. At kickoff, do you want to be standing on the sidelines, or\ndominating the pitch\n\n2. Burn or mount the image\n3. Install the game. Use one of the following serials when prompted\nSHVY-3LE9-TMNH-7K5L-JN73\nE5DW-NHA5-RR9T-DLMH-A6NP\nJX3P-2V79-SYH5-Y46F-TC7L\n4. Copy the content from /Crack directory on the disc to the install\ndirectory of the game\n5. Play the game. Use a firewall on all of the games executables and don't\nattempt to go online\n6. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT\n\n// UPLOADER NOTE STARTS //\nSKIDROW version is working but scene people and RELOADED are saying\nthat SKIDROW version will have some crashes/errors. This torrent (RELOADED version) should be much much more stable.\n\n// UPLOADER NOTE ENDS //",
