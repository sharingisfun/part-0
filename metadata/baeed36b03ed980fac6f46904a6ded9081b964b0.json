The result is a captivating short film.\n\nIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.\n\n&quot;There is literally not an image that shows you what it looks like out there,&quot; Mr Overstreet said.\n\n&quot;The only way to see a scale model of the Solar System is to build one.&quot;\n\nWith an Earth model just the size of a marble, they needed seven miles of empty space to show the whole planetary network. The Sun model was about a meter and a half wide.\n\nThe team used a drone to capture their model from above, showing it as it would look from the edge of the Solar System.\n\nAt sunrise they confirmed that the proportions were accurate by showing how the perspective of the model Sun and the actual Sun were the same size when looking from the model Earth's orbit.\n\nThe filmmaking duo made the model because &quot;itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been done before, and we felt like it,&quot; Mr Overstreet said.\n\nThey hope that the model will give &quot;a true illustration of our place in the universe&quot;.\n\n&quot;ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I really wanted to try to capture,&quot; Mr Overstreet said. &quot;We are on a marble floating in the middle of nothing. When you come face-to-face with that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staggering.&quot;\n\nMr Overstreet and Mr Gorosh are continuing to create a series of short science films examining scientific facts which are difficult to comprehend or visualise.\n\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f5bd9c929db5b9c1dbc5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 4500Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: 256Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 7 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 239 MB\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baeed36b03ed980fac6f46904a6ded9081b964b0","amp;dn":"To.Scale.The.Solar.System.1080p.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baeed36b03ed980fac6f46904a6ded9081b964b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,238,211,107,3,237,152,15,172,111,70,144,74,109,237,144,129,185,100,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
