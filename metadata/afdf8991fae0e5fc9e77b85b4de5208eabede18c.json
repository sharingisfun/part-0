Shortly after leaving Dogville, Grace (Howard) and her father (Willem Dafoe) wander into a gated Alabama community still operating under the tenets of slavery. Appalled to stumble across a brutal scene in which a white master is viciously lashing his slave (Isaach de BankolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©), Grace hastily intercedes and pleads with the abusive man to treat his workers with respect and dignity. When merciless matriarchal plantation owner Mam (Lauren Bacall) dies shortly thereafter, the remaining slaves, who have never tasted freedom and only known life under &quot;Mam's Law,&quot; implore the sympathetic Grace to help ease their turbulent transition toward democratic rule, with disastrous results.\n\n   GeneralComplete name : D:BT UploadsManderlay.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 12mn\n      Bit rate : 1466 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 16.3 MiB\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 0/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 2h 12mn\n      Bit rate : 1329 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 272 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.304\n      StreamSize : 1.23 GiB\n      Writing library :  build=2005.09.25\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 2h 12mn\n      Bit rate : 129 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 122 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.96r\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0342735\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese subtitles\n\nFilm split into 2 files.
