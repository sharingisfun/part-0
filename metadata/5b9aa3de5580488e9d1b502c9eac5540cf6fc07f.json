When he comes up with an idea to make a self conscious robot named Chappie to protect better, his higher-ups disapprove it. Nonetheless, he makes it and when the company finds out, scraps the robot. When 2 small time criminals planning a $200 million heist find Chappie, they kidnap Deon and force him to program Chappie to assist them in their heist. When power-corrupted military general Vincent (Hugh Jackman) finds out, he rallies all forces to stop Chappie, at any cost that leads to an monumental showdown between Good and Evil. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b9aa3de5580488e9d1b502c9eac5540cf6fc07f","amp;dn":"Chappie+%282015%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b9aa3de5580488e9d1b502c9eac5540cf6fc07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,154,163,222,85,128,72,142,157,27,80,44,158,172,85,64,207,111,192,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
