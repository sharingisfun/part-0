Most of the time I do not use it from the installed program, I use the Boot CD. This requires no installation, tends to have less issues. It is amazingly easy to use.\r\n\r\nWhatÃ¢Â€â„¢s New in Acronis True Image 2017:\r\nThe Fastest Backup in the Industry\r\nAs a global partner of the Scuderia Toro Rosso Formula 1 Racing Team, Acronis is committed to delivering the fastest data protection products in the industry. The new Acronis True Image 2017 is between 3 times to 6 times faster than the nearest competitor when backing up to an external hard drive, and 30% faster when backing up to Apple Time Machine. When backing up to the Acronis Cloud, the new 2017 release is up to 25% faster than last yearÃ¢Â€â„¢s version.\r\n\r\nBack up your mobile device content\r\nMobile phone operating systems take care of applications and settings. Acronis protects photos, videos, contacts, reminders, and calendar appointments. Now, you can back up mobile devices to a local Windows computer in addition to the cloud.\r\n\r\nManage backup plans remotely\r\nConfigure backups and review status for any computer or mobile device regardless of location. Great for family or home office data protection.\r\n\r\nIncremental Social Backup\r\nDonÃ¢Â€â„¢t let accidental deletion or social network errors erase your memories and photos. Automatically back up\nâ€“ Back up only changes to your feed, not the whole feed each time, to reduce backup size.\r\nâ€“ Works in the background without user intervention.\r\nâ€“ Have complete control of your images without needing to rely on native social media tools.\r\n\r\nFast, powerful search\r\nSearch for files within local and cloud backups, archives. Make sure you are recovering from the correct backup to save time. Or recover one file â€” the correct one â€” instead of having to recover an entire backup and then search.\r\n\r\nEasy to setup notifications\r\nE-mail notifications reduce uncertainty and provide confidence about your backup status â€” even if you walk away from your computer.\r\n\r\nArchive\r\nSave space by securely archiving older files to local drives or the cloud. Yet retain easy access to them via icons in Windows Explorer or Mac Finder or via web browser.\r\n\r\nJust Two Clicks\r\nIt takes just two clicks to perform a full image backup. One click to add a new backup plan, the second click to start it. Of course if you want them, deep technical options and settings are just one more click away","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d3e4ca42edcd5c3313496aff6b6957d6816e2c6","amp;dn":"Acronis+True+Image+2017+20.0+Build+5554+Bootable+ISO+%5BSadeemPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d3e4ca42edcd5c3313496aff6b6957d6816e2c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,62,76,164,46,220,213,195,49,52,150,175,246,182,149,125,104,22,226,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
