He is widely considered to be the greatest electric guitarist in musical history, and one of the most influential musicians of his era across a range of genres. After initial success in Europe with his group The Jimi Hendrix Experience, he achieved fame in the United States following his 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival. Later, Hendrix headlined the iconic 1969 Woodstock Festival and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. He often favored raw overdriven amplifiers with high gain and treble and helped develop the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback. Hendrix, as well as his friend Eric Clapton, popularized use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock which he often used to deliver an exaggerated pitch in his solos, particularly with high bends, complex guitar playing, and use of legato. As a record producer, Hendrix also broke new ground in using the recording studio as an extension of his musical ideas. He was one of the first to experiment with stereophonic phasing\neffects for rock recording. Hendrix was influenced by blues artists such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Albert King and Elmore James, rhythm and blues and soul guitarists Curtis Mayfield and Steve Cropper, and the jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Hendrix (who was then known as 'Maurice James') began dressing and wearing a moustache like Little Richard when he performed and recorded in his band from March 1, 1964 through to the spring of 1965. In 1966, Hendrix stated, &quot;I want to do with my guitar what Little Richard does with his voice.&quot;\nHendrix won many of the most prestigious rock music awards in his lifetime, and has been posthumously awarded many more, including being inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. An English Heritage blue plaque was erected in his name on his former residence at Brook Street, London, in September 1997. A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (at 6627 Hollywood Blvd.) was dedicated in 1994. In 2006, his debut US album, Are You Experienced, was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry, and Rolling Stone named Hendrix the top guitarist on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all-time in 2003. He was the first person inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame.\n\n.: Jimi Hendrix :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/1667/rockroll026jimihendrix.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/1667/rockroll026jimihendrix.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n(while alive) STUDIO ALBUMS\n1967 Are You Experienced (Japan, 2 CD) @320\n1967 Axis Bold As Love @320\n1968 Electric Lady Land @320\n\n(while alive) LIVE ALBUMS\n1967 Live At Monterey Pop Festival @320\n1970 Band Of Gypsys @320\n\n(posthumous) STUDIO ALBUMS\n1967 Radio One @320\n1968 Jimi By Himself (The Home Recordings) @320\n1969 Good Times @320\n1970 Electric Lady (Mixing Sessions) @320\n1971 Rainbow Bridge (Original Motion Picture Sound Track) @320\n1971 The Cry Of Love @320\n1972 War Heroes @320\n1974 Loose Ends @320\n1975 Midnight Lightning @320\n1980 Nine To The Universe (LP) @320\n1991 Cherokee Mist @320\n1994 Ultra Rare Trax @320\n2004 Crash Landing (Unreleased) @320\n2006 Message From Nine To The Universe @320\n2008 Feed Back (Collectors Edition) @320\n2008 Outakes Jam ETCS @320\n\n(posthumous) LIVE ALBUMS\n1965 Drivin South (The George s Club 20, New Jersey, dec 26) @320\n1965 Two Great Experiences (Jimi Hendrix &amp; Lonnie Youngblood) @320\n1968 Woke Up This Morning And Found Myself Dead (Live In NY) @320\n1969 Live At Winterland @320\n1969 Live At Woodstock (2 CD) @320\n1969 Woodstock @320\n1969-06-20 Newport Pop Festival (3 CD) @320\n1970 Isle of Wight (Netherlands) @320\n1970 Isle Of Wight (USA) @320\n1970 Live at Berkeley 1st show @320\n1970 Live At Berkeley 2nd Show @320\n1971 In The West @320\n1989 The Jimi Hendrix Concerts @320\n2002 Blue Wild Angel (Live At The Isle Of Wight)(2 CD) @320\n\n(posthumous) COMPILATIONS AND BOX SETS\n1968-10-10 3 Nights At Winterland (Live Collector's Edition, 6 CD) @320\n1969 Band Of Gypsys Rehearsals (2 CD) @320\\CD1 1969-12-20\n1969 Band Of Gypsys Rehearsals (2 CD) @320\\CD2 1969-12-22\n1969 The Electric Church (2 CD) @320\n1969-12-31 Fillmore East New York City (1st Show) @320\n1969-12-31 Fillmore East New York City (2nd Show) @320\n1970 South Saturn Delta @320\n1983 The Singles Album (2 CD) @320\n1993 First Rays Of The New Rising Sun (Studio Sessions 1969-70 Bootleg) @320\n1994 Blues (1966-1970) @320\n1995 Voodoo Soup 1969-1970 @320\n1996 Black Gold 1967-1970 Vol 1 (2 CD) @320\n1996 Black Gold 1967-1970 Vol 2 (2 CD) @320\n1996 Black Gold 1967-1970 Vol 3 (320) @320\n1998 BBC Session 1967-1969 (2 CD) @320\n1999 Unsurpassed Studio Takes @320\n2000 The Jimi Hendrix Experience (4 CD) @320\n2002 At His Best (2 CD) @320\n2003 Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues - Jimi Hendrix @320\n2004 Blues Outtakes (Raw Blues 1968-1970) (2 CD) @320\n2005 Axis Outtakes (2 CD) @320\n2006 In The Studio Collectors (Limited Edition, 10CD) @320\n2006 Studio '67 (6 CD) @320\n\nEXPERIENCE HENDRIX OFFICIAL BOOTLEGS (some)\n1967 Are You Experienced (US Jimi Hendrix Experience) @320\n1968 Can You Dig That - Music Hall (Live Houston) @320\n1969 Albert Hall Experience (Live At The Royal Albert Hall)(2 CD) @320\n1969-06-29 Denver Pop Festival @320\n1970 Civic Center (Live Baltimore June 13) @320\n1970-04-25 Los Angeles Forum @320\n2002 The Baggy's Rehearsal Sessions @320\n\nDAGGER RECORDS OFFICIAL BOOTLEGS (some)\n1968 Capitol Theatre (Ottawa March 13) @320\n1970 Burning Desire @320\n1970-06-09 Away From This Rainy Cloud (Isle Of Fehmarn) @320\n2003 Paris 1967 - San Francisco 1968 @320",
