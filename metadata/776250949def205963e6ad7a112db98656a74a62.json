At your disposal is a collection of parts, which must be assembled to create a functional ship. Each part has its own function and will affect the way a ship flies (or doesn't). So strap yourself in, and get ready to try some Rocket Science!\n\nThe game has different game modes, you can play the Career Mode if you want to expand and manage your own Space Center, taking on missions and researching new technologies. Or you can play Sandbox mode if you're only interested in flying and discovering the Kerbal universe without restrictions. There is even a mid point between these two, Science mode.\n\n\n== Features:\nThe Vehicle Assembly Building and the Space Plane Hangar allows players to build spacecraft out of any imaginable combination of parts.\nFully-fledged, Physics-based Space Flight Simulation ensures everything will fly (and crash) as it should.\nTake your Kerbal crew out of the ship and do Extra Vehicular Activities.\nFly out to Moons and other Planets.\nProcedural Terrain delivers detailed terrain at a vast scale. The Kerbal Planet is 600km in radius!\nMod-enabled, allows players to create new content and modify the game.\nShip systems. Keep an eye out for engine temperatures and fuel levels, and try not to explode.\nBuild ships with multiple stages, and jettison parts away as they burn out.\nFull control over the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s setup allows for complex ships and advanced functionality.\nDock spacecraft together to build Space Stations, Massive Starships, or even surface bases on other worlds.\nManage your crewmembers, hire them, and send them out into space and make them into heroes.\nResearch and Develop new technologies to advance your Space Program.\nTake on Missions to attract interest in your Space Program.\nDiscover new worlds and expand the scientific knowledge of Kerbalkind.\nAnd a whole lot more!\n\n\n== Version:\nGame version 1.0 or GOG setup 2.0.0.1 from Apr 27 2015. \n\n\n== Version changes:\n -- shortened --\nThese are the highlights:\n\nAerodynamics\nThe flight model has had a complete overhaul\nThe drag simulation has also been completely revised\nStack mounted parts are now occluded from drag by neighboring parts, and lift induced drag is also properly simulated...\n\nHeating\nA new heating simulation has been implemented together with the improved aerodynamics. \nAtmospheric temperature (and density) takes into account latitude and the position of the Sun. \nCelestial bodies now accurately emit thermal radiation that makes nearby craft warmer. \nFinally, ablative heat shields have been added to protect the parts behind them from reentry heating...\n\nFairings\nYou can now add fairings to your rockets! The design of the fairing is left up to you.\nOnce you've placed the fairings you can still edit your payload! \nFairings will shield anything inside them from drag and heat, making them an ideal tool for making payloads survive even more aggressive aerodynamic stresses...\n\nResource Mining\nMining for Resources is now a part of Kerbal Space Program: set out to find Ore, which can be found throughout the Solar system, including on asteroids. To help you find the Ore, new map overlays have been implemented on all celestial bodies, and new UI elements have been added to various pieces of equipment.\n\nInstructions:It's a GOG version, just launch setup\nClick options to chose location and accept EULA, install \nPlay - Enjoy - Seed - give me what I need\nSpeed!
