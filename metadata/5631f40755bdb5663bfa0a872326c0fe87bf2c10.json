  "description": "About Minecraft:\nMinecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters, but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative things. It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea.\n\nMinecraft Launcher features:\nDownload and play all Minecraft versions (official versions, alpha, beta and weekly snapshots).\nMultiple Launcher profiles and user profiles.\nPlay *online* on cracked (known as offline servers) servers.\n\nAdditional information:\nThis torrent comes with predownloaded files for Minecraft 1.8.4.\n\nInstructions:\n - Download files.\n - Run setup and install Launcher.\n - You will now have &quot;Minecraft&quot; icon on your desktop - use it to start Launcher\n - Enter your &quot;username&quot; - it can be anything you want\n - Press &quot;Play&quot; button\n - Enjoy Minecraft :)\n\nIf you don't have Microsoft .NET Framework 4 you can get it here:\n - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851 - Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Web Installer)\n - https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=17718 - Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Standalone Installer) \n \nYou also need Java, you can get it here:\n - https://java.com/en/download/",
