Three Days Grace were formed in Norwood, Ontario, Canada, in 1997 by Adam Gontier (vocals, guitar), Brad Walst (bass), and Neil Sanderson (drums). The group was originally called Groundswell, a five-piece that lasted from 1992 until transforming to a trio five years later. Gontier and Walst were raised in Norwood, and many of their songs were inspired by living in a place with a population of around 1,500. The bandmembers were still in high school when they had their first gig, and they performed anywhere that would accept them -- including opening for a movie. \n\n\nMp3 CBR 320\nContains Album Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nThree Days Grace (2003)\n\nOne-X (2006)\n\nLife Starts Now (2009)\n\nTransit Of Venus (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0052bc0bc09fd459963f145d01b6e1fe6d6aae","amp;dn":"Three+Days+Grace+-+Studio+Discography+%282003-2012%29+%5B320%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0052bc0bc09fd459963f145d01b6e1fe6d6aae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,0,82,188,11,192,159,212,89,150,63,20,93,1,182,225,254,109,106,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
