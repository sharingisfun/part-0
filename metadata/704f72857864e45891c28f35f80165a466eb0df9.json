Before he awakens to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits. Before a man Jasonâ€™s never met smiles down at him and says, â€œWelcome back, my friend.â€\r\n\r\nIn this world heâ€™s woken up to, Jasonâ€™s life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable--something impossible.\r\n\r\nIs it this world or the other thatâ€™s the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than anything he couldâ€™ve imaginedâ€”one that will force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Jon Lindstrom\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 56 Kbps\r\nUnabridged\r\nPublished: July 26th 2016 by Random House Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704f72857864e45891c28f35f80165a466eb0df9","amp;dn":"Blake+Crouch+-+Dark+Matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704f72857864e45891c28f35f80165a466eb0df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,79,114,133,120,100,228,88,145,194,143,53,248,1,101,164,102,235,13,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
