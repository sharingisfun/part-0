Following the third mission, the player assumes the role of a soldier assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, taking part in Operation Gothic Serpent, a military operation conducted during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. During the latter section of the game, the player controls members of the 3rd Ranger Battalion and 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game is based on the 1992-93 UN peace missions in war-torn Somalia. The first few missions in the game are designed to make the player accustomed with the different types of weapons, their usage, enemy AI, terrain types and combat techniques. The majority of the missions involve convoy protection, providing security for food distributions, destroying weapon stockpiles, taking prisoners, etc.\nThe Windows and PlayStation 2 versions of the game have an expansion set called Team Sabre, which features two additional campaigns. One involves missions to shut down a drug cartel in Colombia, and the other involves missions against a paramilitary rebel group in Iran.\n\n*********DELTA FORCE BLACK HAWK DOWN TEAM SABRE*********\n\nexpansion pack to Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. Team Sabre adds more weapons. The Team Sabre expansion gives the player a new character to choose, the British elite commando unit SAS. Team Sabre adds a few more terrains which are mostly jungle and desert terrains. The expansion pack also gives the player two more campaigns which are in fictional based areas, fighting the renegade general Haatim Jaareah Kalb in the deserts of Iran and the elusive drug lord Antonio Paulo in the jungles of Colombia. The main difference from the original is the difficulty, with fewer saves and longer levels.\n\nCOLOMBIAN CAMPAIGN:\nFollowing a Coast Guard discovery of a large shipment of drugs and guns headed for the United States, intel has revealed that a powerful drug lord, Antonio Paulo, is trying to increase his power in parts of Colombia. This drug lord controls entire regions in remote parts of the country and employs many well-armed guerrillas to fight for him in exchange for money and weapons to aid their anti-government cause. He is known for his heavy-handed actions, including the torture of captured Colombian and American soldiers.\n\nIRANIAN CAMPAIGN:\nIran's fundamentalist government has given way to a less hardline administration, friendly to the West. A significant portion of the old guard, appalled with the new government's embracing of economic relationships with the &quot;corrupt, morally evil&quot; western powers, has taken up arms in a second revolution against the state. While government forces aided by NATO troops have managed to keep control of Tehran, fundamentalist rebels have seized control of the oil terminal on Kharg Island and production facilities to the north and Bandar Shahpur. Oil represents three-quarters of Iran's economy and a serious risk to the interests of western investors. NATO and the UN have both agreed that military intervention, led by the United States, is warranted. Delta Force has been tasked with being the spearhead of the coalition forces.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c954a88f7eec3538debc0c07d47d4ec95655f48","amp;dn":"Delta+Force+Black+Hawk+Down+%2B+Team+Sabre+%28v1.5.0.5%29+%28Direct+Play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c954a88f7eec3538debc0c07d47d4ec95655f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,149,74,136,247,238,195,83,141,235,192,192,125,71,212,236,149,101,95,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
