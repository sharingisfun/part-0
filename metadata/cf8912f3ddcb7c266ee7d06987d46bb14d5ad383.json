  "description": "GOG \r\nPRESENTS \r\n\r\nNo Mans Sky \r\n(C) Hello Games \r\n\r\nInformation: \r\n\r\nDate: August 12, 2016\r\nGame Type: Action \r\nLanguage: English \r\nProtection: None \r\n\r\nGame Notes: \r\n\r\nInspired by the adventure and imagination that \r\nwe love from classic science-fiction, No Man's \r\nSky presents you with a galaxy to explore, \r\nfilled with unique planets and lifeforms, \r\nand constant danger and action. \r\n\r\nSystem Requirements: \r\n\r\nWindows: 7 / 8 / 10 (64-bit only) \r\nProcessor: Core i3 \r\nMemory: 8GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVidia GTX 480, AMD Radeon 7870 \r\nHard Drive: 10 GB \r\nMouse, Keyboard \r\n\r\nFor more info go to :  \nhttps://www.gog.com/game/no_mans_sky \r\n\r\nUpdate Info: \r\n\r\nPatch 1289496 (22 August 2016) \r\n\r\n* Patch 3 is targeted at our next most common support requests, \r\nfixing the next most common crashes, as well as trying to help \r\nplayers who have become stranded or have corrupted their \r\nsave files.\r\n\r\n- Stranded in Space Station:\r\nIf you died in your ship while in atmosphere of a planet with a \r\ndamaged ship, you could respawn in a space station with your \r\nlaunch thrusters and pulse engine damaged. If you did not have \r\nthe resources to fix them then you could no longer take off and \r\nbe stuck there. This will no longer happen.\r\n\r\n- Loading Corrupted Save Files:\r\nSome players have corrupted save files, weâ€™ve been working with \r\nthem to still load saves even if they are corrupted \r\n(this can happen for many reasons outside of the games control). \r\nThis fix has allowed many players to still load their save even if \r\nthey have become corrupt on PC.\r\n\r\n- Crash fixes for next three most commonly reported issues:\r\n* As the player gathers a huge amount of discoveries, there was \r\na threading issue that becomes more prevalent the more \r\ndiscoveries you have, and could cause the game to crash.\r\n* If you had collected a large number of blueprints, in a specific \r\norder it was possible to crash the game when you received \r\na new blueprint. This has been fixed.\r\n* Players who set a large number of waypoints could find \r\nthemselves in a situation where they could crash the game in \r\nthe Galactic Map, this is remedied now \r\n(PS. A better waypoint system is coming).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThis is total Package with fully latest Updated No Mans Sky Game, \r\nit also includes previous Patch so if someone wants it they can apply \r\nit and also the latest patch, if you guys do not want the new 2.3.0.5 \r\ninstaller then you can pick only the patch for applying so you \r\ncustomized on your own, Enjoy the game and we hope the devs \r\nadd more patches in the future for those who are still facing \r\nproblems playing this game, cheers.\r\n\r\nInstall Notes: \r\n\r\n1. Download \r\n2. Install the game \r\n3. Run the game as administrator \r\n4. Have fun \r\n\r\nGreetings: To all our friends \r\n\r\nSince 2008 \r\n\r\nSUPPORT THE COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE QUALITY SOFTWARE IF YOU \r\nENJOYED THIS PRODUCT, BUY IT SOFTWARE AUTHORS DESERVE SUPPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/dulVg9r.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\n   \nhttp://i.imgur.com/dnboKSw.jpg\r\n\r\n   \nhttp://i.imgur.com/321d2fS.jpg\r\n\r\n   \nhttp://i.imgur.com/mhdWOaX.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED AND ENJOY!",
