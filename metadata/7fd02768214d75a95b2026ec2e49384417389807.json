  "description": "Kaixo, Hello, Sali Zaemmae!!! \nHere is another great classic from my mother's video collection. Today it's nothing less than ALL 11 seasons of THE BEST SITCOM EVER. I am talking of course about Married with Children. I wouldn't be what I am without Al Bundy's wisdoms. \nThey're all in English with hardcoded subtitles.\nI recommend VLC-player to watch them if you do not want to see the subtitles. As I am not a native English speaker they are very helpful to me too understand better and also to improve my English.\n \nAnd here is some REAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION: \nThis is the one and only way how to prepare the real Marianito preparao as it has to be on sunday morning after church: \nGive about five or six ice cubes into a jar \nnow a litlle hint of Angostura over the ice (0,5 cl) \nadd some fine quality gin and Red CuraÃƒÂ§ao (1cl of each) \nnow add Martini Rosso (10cl) \nstir it , NEVER AND IN NO WAY THINK ABOUT SHAKING HIM !!!!!! \npour it with filtering the ice into two cocktailglasses \nadd a piece of orange skin lightly pressed over each of the Marianitos preparaos. \nEnjoy with some Olives or caracoliÃƒÂ±os. And thank the lord that you are so lucky to live in Bilbao, the center of the universe where they make the best of them. AMEN \n\n\nPlease don't be upsetted if the download may take a while: I can only upload with a speed of about 200 KBit/s. Blame Euskaltel and or the basque and especially the spanish government for it !!!!! \n\nHave also a look on other torrents I've posted and feel free to place a comment or a feedback. I would be very glad about. Eskerrik asko ! Thank you! \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nBerne is the capital of Switzerland. It has seven times the size of the graveyard of Naples, but it's only half as funny. (Luciano di Crescenco) \n\nSEED OR YOU'LL GET ANAL PUNISHMENT BY ROCCO SIFFREDDI!!! ",
