Reunited with his estranged father, Talbot sets out to find his brother... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline has come to investigate.\n\nSeed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a5521c515f7b74c22e7fdc6d6e81ec1e35754d","amp;dn":"The+Wolfman+%282010%29+Unrated+720p+-+600MB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a5521c515f7b74c22e7fdc6d6e81ec1e35754d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,165,82,28,81,95,123,116,194,46,127,220,109,110,129,236,30,53,117,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
