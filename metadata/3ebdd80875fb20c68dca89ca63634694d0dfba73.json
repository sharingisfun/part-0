The distinction is clear'. Such were the words of the master detective Sherlock Holmes to Dr Watson, as he noted how his friend failed to implement Holmes' techniques. In &quot;How to think like Sherlock&quot; you will learn how to increase your powers of observation, memory, deduction and reasoning using the tricks and techniques of the world's most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. \n\nThe book incorporates the latest techniques and theories across a range of topics: NLP, memory mapping, body language, information shifting and speed reading - this is a supremely practical book that will make you look at the world in a new light, and more importantly, impress those around you. Packed full of case studies, quotes and trivia from Arthur Conan Doyle's original novels and short stories, the book also includes a series of fun tasks and games for you to complete that will ensure that when you reach the end of the book you will be thinking like Sherlock Holmes, the master of the science of deduction. You will never look at a shirt cuff, trouser hem or scuff of dirt on a shoe in the same way again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.angusrobertson.com.au/images/ar/97818431/9781843179535/0/0/plain/how-to-think-like-sherlock-improve-your-powers-of-observation-memory-and-deduction.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.angusrobertson.com.au/images/ar/97818431/9781843179535/0/0/plain/how-to-think-like-sherlock-improve-your-powers-of-observation-memory-and-deduction.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
