  "description": "Band:\nSlayer is an American thrash metal band formed in Huntington Park, California in 1981 by guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer rose to mainstream fame with their 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; thrash metal acts, along with Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's sales are in the estimated high 20 millions, although they have never publicly announced their sales worldwide. However, between the years 1991 and 2004, Slayer sold over 3.5 million albums in the U.S.\n\nSlayer's musical style involve fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, and shouted vocals. Hanneman, King, and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya, contribute to the band's lyrics. King and Hanneman create and arrange the music with additional help from drummer Dave Lombardo and sometimes Araya. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, necrophilia, Satanism, religion, anti-religion, and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and the public. Their music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically.\nimage\nSince their debut album in 1983, the band has released two live albums, one box set, six videos, two extended plays, and eleven studio albums, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning two of them. One in 2007 for the song &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot;, and one in 2008 for the song &quot;Final Six&quot; (both from 2006's Christ Illusion). Slayer has played music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download, and Ozzfest. Slayer is currently writing a new studio album, which is due for release in 2013.\n\nQuote:\nNext album and current events (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nIn a May 2011 interview with Geeks of Doom, Dave Lombardo was asked if Slayer was going to make another album. He replied: &quot;Yes absolutely; Although there's nothing written, there are definitely plans. Of course. We have to. Why not? I'm not retiring and I don't think Kerry [King] is retiring either so... I like longevity and a true musician never abandons his art.&quot; However, Tom Araya said that Slayer would not begin writing a new album until Jeff Hanneman's condition improved. When asked about Hanneman's condition in July 2011, Araya told LinnÃƒÂ©a Olsson of Sveriges Television (SVT): &quot;Jeff was seriously ill. Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder, and they did a skin graft on him, they cleaned up... It was a flesh-eating virus, so he was really, really bad. So we'll wait for him to get better, and when he's a hundred percent, he's gonna come out and join us.&quot;\n\nOn November 21, 2011, Guitar World posted an announcement that Dave Lombardo tweeted that the band had started to write new music. The tweet read: &quot;SLAYER is writing a new record and PHILM is about to start mixing their debut record. Looking forward to touring again with new music.&quot; This presumably meant that Jeff Hanneman had improved on his condition dealing with his health and was ready to enter the studio again.&quot; In an interview with Artisan News in February 2012, Kerry stated that he worked with Dave before the holidays and they had 3 songs down. They planned on hitting the studio in either March or April; Jeff was already starting to write his contributions to the album as well. They were hoping to have the album fully recorded before their U.S. tour in late May and release it by the summer of 2012. However, according to King, the upcoming Slayer album would not be finished until September and October of that year, making a 2013 release likely.\n\nOctober 7, 2011 marked the 25th anniversary for Slayer's third studio album Reign In Blood. To celebrate the anniversary, the band will be performing Reign In Blood at the All Tomorrow's Parties &quot;I'll Be Your Mirror&quot; festival at Alexandra Palace, London. Slayer joined the sludge metal band Melvins on May 25, 2012. Slayer was announced to be coheadlining Mayhem Festival 2012 alongside Slipknot, and more.\n\nSlayer confirmed their first concert in India in October, 2012.\n\nIn a July 2012 interview with Rick Florino of ARTISTdirect.com, Kerry King revealed two song titles for the upcoming album, &quot;Chasing Death&quot; and &quot;Implode&quot;. Their next album will be out in 2013.\n\nOn February 21, 2013, Dave Lombardo released a press statement on his Facebook page that he would not be playing Australia's Soundwave festival citing an argument with band members over a pay dispute. Slayer and American Records refuted the statement stating &quot;Mr. Lombardo came to the band less than a week before their scheduled departure for Australia to present an entirely new set of terms for his engagement that were contrary to those that had been previously agreed upon&quot; although Lombardo claimed there was a gag order in place.\n\n\nWriting and style\nEarly works were praised for their &quot;breakneck speed and instrumental prowess,&quot; combining the structure of hardcore tempos and speed metal the band released fast, aggressive material. The album Reign in Blood is the band's fastest, performed at an average of 220 beats per minute. The album Diabolus in Musica was the band's first with drop D tuning, God Hates Us All the first with C# tuning. Allmusic cited the album as &quot;abandoning the extravagances and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returning to perfect the raw approach,&quot; with some fans labeling it nu metal.\n\nHanneman and King's dual guitar solos have been called &quot;wildly chaotic,&quot; and &quot;twisted genius.&quot; Drummer Lombardo uses two bass drums, instead of the double kick which is used on a single bass drum. Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the &quot;godfather of double bass&quot; by Drummerworld. Lombardo states his reasons for using two bass drums: &quot;When you hit the bass drum the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place right after that you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe.&quot; When playing the double bass Lombardo uses the &quot;heel-up&quot; technique.\n\nIn an interview with Modern Drummer, Lombardo has stated that he always starts playing drum beats with his left foot.\n\nHanneman, King and Araya contribute to the band's lyrics, and King and Hanneman create and arrange the music with additional arrangement from Lombardo and sometimes Araya. Final Six (from Christ Illusion) is the only song by Slayer which Araya co-wrote the music for, whereas Lombardo has not received any writing credits in Slayer's history. Araya has formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which can overshadow the creative input of King. Hanneman states writing lyrics and music is a &quot;free for all&quot;; &quot;It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with KerryÃ¢â‚¬â€ it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good we use it, if not we don't.&quot;\n\nWhen writing new material, the band writes the music before incorporating lyrics. King or Hanneman will use a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff they have created, and to get their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo will mention if any alterations can be made. The band will play the riff to get the basic song structure, and figure out where the lyrics and solos will be placed. Hanneman, King and Araya tend to have different lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics deal with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics. King's lyrics are generally anti-religious. Araya's lyrics usually deal with less controversial topics than Hanneman's and King's, such as serial killers and warfare.But the future album was delayed and almost didn't happen due to Jeff Hanneman's death from liver failure on May 2, 2013, in a Southern California hospital near his home. On May 9, 2013, the official cause of death was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death. And than they were forced to find a new/old drummer since Lombardo is estranged from the band  and also has another gig. But nothing lasts forever except death, so we shall see what the future will bring to these pioneers of the Heaviest Music. \nBut there will be a album out soon Because of The Slayer Exodus and Suicidal Tendencies tour thats gonna kick off this winter, so keep watching these pages for Metal and info and whatever else that I find to share.For more see Slayer wiki.   \nBut it does look like Gary Holt will be seeing double duty as he is the lead guitar in Exodus and now also fulltime in Slayer. \n\n\n\n\n\nStudio Discography:\n1983 -- Show No Mercy (Full-length)\n1985 -- Hell Awaits (Full-length)\n1986 -- Reign In Blood (Full-length)\n1988 -- South Of Heaven (Full-length)\n1990 -- Seasons In The Abyss (Full-length)\n1994 -- Divine Intervention (Full-length)\n1996 -- Undisputed Attitude (Full-length)\n1998 -- Diabolus In Musica (Full-length)\n2001 -- God Hates Us All (Full-length)\n2006 -- Christ Illusion (Full-length)\n2009 -- World Painted Blood (Full-length)\n\n\nCurrent Line-up:\n\nKerry King -- Guitars (1981-present)\nPaul Bostaph -- Drums (1992-1996, 1997-2001)2014-present\nTom Araya -- Vocals, Bass (1982-present)\n\nJon Dette (Live) -- Drums (1996, 2013-present)\nGary Holt (Live) -- Guitars (2011-present)\n\n\nFormer Members:\n\nJeff Hanneman -- Guitars (1981-2013)\nBob Gourley (Live) -- Drums (1983)\nTony Scaglione (Live) -- Drums (1986-1987)\nPat O'Brien (Live) -- Guitars (2011)\nDave Lombardo -- Drums (1982-1986, 1987-1992, 2001-2012\n\nTracklist:\n\n2012 -- Greatest Hits -- [2CD Digipack Edition]\n\n\n\nCD1:\n01.
