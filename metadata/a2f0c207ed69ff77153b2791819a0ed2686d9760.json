  "description": "Genesis - Discography 1969-2008 [Mp3 320 kbps] TNT Village\n\n.: Release Originale :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=240934&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=240934&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenesis are an English rock band that formed in 1967. The band currently comprises the longest-tenured members Phil Collins (lead vocals and drums), Mike Rutherford (guitar and bass guitar), and Tony Banks (keyboards). Peter Gabriel, Anthony Phillips and Steve Hackett also played major roles in the band in its early years. Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.\nGenesis began as a 1960s pop band. During the 1970s, they evolved into a progressive rock band, incorporating complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation, while their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, elaborate costumes and on-stage stories. This second phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23 minute &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; and the 1974 concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. In the 1980s, the band produced accessible pop music based on melodic hooks; this change of direction gave them their first number one album in the United Kingdom, Duke, and their only number one single in the United States, &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;.\nGenesis has changed personnel several times. Stage fright forced founding member Anthony Phillips to leave the band in 1970. In 1975, Collins, then the band's drummer, replaced Peter Gabriel as lead singer after a lengthy search for a replacement. To facilitate Collins's move to lead vocals during concerts, Bill Bruford, and later Chester Thompson, played drums for the band as they toured, with Collins joining in briefly during lengthy instrumental passages. In 1977, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band. After Phil Collins left the band in 1996, Genesis recruited Ray Wilson (formerly of Stiltskin). Wilson appeared on the 1997 album Calling All Stations, after which the band announced an indefinite hiatus. However, in 2007, Banks, Collins and Rutherford reunited for a 20-city tour of Europe and North America, which included a free concert at Rome's Circo Massimo in front of 500,000 fans. Genesis was among five bands inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\n.: Genesis Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img225.imageshack.us/img225/7690/800px2180pittsburghmell.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img225.imageshack.us/img225/7690/800px2180pittsburghmell.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nSTUDIO\n1969 From Genesis To Revelation (2005 EDSEL Edition)(2 CD) @320\n1970 Trespass (2007 Remaster) @320\n1971 Nursery Cryme (2007 Remaster) @320\n1972 Foxtrot (2007 Remaster) @320\n1973 Selling England by the Pound (2007 Remaster) @320\n1974 The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (2007 Remaster) (2 CD) @320\n1976 A Trick Of The Tail (2007 Remaster) @320\n1976 Wind and Wuthering (2007 Remaster) @320\n1978 And Then There Were Three (2007 Remaster) @320\n1980 Duke (2007 Remaster) @320\n1981 Abacab (2007 Remaster) @320\n1983 Genesis (2007 Remaster) @320\n1986 Invisible Touch (2007 Remaster) @320\n1991 We Can't Dance (2007 Remaster) @320\n1997 Calling All Stations (2007 Remaster) @320\n\nLIVE\n1973 Genesis Live (Remaster) @320\n1973 Live At The Rainbow (Remaster) @320\n1977 Seconds Out (Remaster) @320\n1978 Live In Tokyo (unofficial) (2 CD) @320\n1982 Three Sides Live (Remaster) (2 CD) @320\n1992 The Way We Walk (Remaster) (2 CD) @320\n1992 The Way We Walk, Volume 1 - The Shorts @320\n1993 The Way We Walk, Volume 2 - The Longs @320\n1997 Nothing Left Now (unofficial) @320\n2007 Live Over Europe (2 CD) @320\n\nCOMPILATIONS\n1986 Rock Theatre @320\n1998 Archive No 1 1967-1975 (4 CD) @320\n1998 Romantic Ballads @320\n1999 Turn It On Again - Best Of 81-83 @320\n2000 Archive No 2 1976-1992 (3 CD) @320\n2004 Platinum Collection (3 CD) @320\n2007 Extra Tracks (Remaster) (3 CD) @320\n2007 Turn It on Again (2 CD) @320\n2008 Rewiring Genesis (A Tribute To The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway) (2 CD) @320\n\nSOME EP &amp; SINGLES\n1977 Spot The Pigeon (EP) @320\n1986 Land Of Confusion (EP) @320\n1991 I Can't Dance (Single) @320\n1991 No Son Of Mine (Single) @320\n1992 Hold On My Heart (Single) @320\n1992 Jesus He Knows Me (Single) @320",
