  "description": "John Winston Ono Lennon, MBE (9 October 1940 ? 8 December 1980), was an Academy Award and Grammy Award-winning English songwriter, singer, musician, graphic artist, author and political activist who gained worldwide fame as one of the founders of The Beatles. Lennon and Paul McCartney formed a critically acclaimed and commercially successful partnership writing songs for The Beatles and other artists.[1] Lennon, with his cynical edge and knack for introspection, and McCartney, with his storytelling optimism and gift for melody, complemented one another uniquely.[2] In his solo career, Lennon wrote and recorded songs such as &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;.\n\nLennon revealed his rebellious nature and irreverent wit on television, in films such as A Hard Day&amp;#039;s Night (1964), in books such as In His Own Write, and in press conferences and interviews. He channelled his fame and penchant for controversy into his work as a peace activist, artist, and author.\n\nHe had two sons, Julian, with his first wife Cynthia, and Sean, with his second wife, avant-garde artist Yoko Ono. Lennon was murdered by a deranged fan, Mark David Chapman, in New York City on 8 December 1980 after he and Ono returned home from a recording session.\n\nIn 2002, respondents to a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted Lennon into eighth place. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Lennon number 38 on their list of &quot;The Immortals: The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;[3][4] and ranked The Beatles at number 1.\n\nLennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon is the third official compilation album of John Lennon&amp;#039;s solo career, coming after 1975&amp;#039;s Shaved Fish and 1982&amp;#039;s The John Lennon Collection. Because neither collection spanned Lennon&amp;#039;s releases up to and including 1984&amp;#039;s Milk And Honey, Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon - considered the definitive Lennon retrospective - was compiled to rectify the situation. It was released in the UK in 1997 and early 1998 in the United States.\n\nLennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon reached #3 in the UK and #65 in the U.S. where it went gold. The album re-entered the UK Chart on 18th June 2007, almost 10 years after its release, at #30.\n\nLennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon was also released on DVD in 2003 as a series of remastered, remixed &amp; new music videos with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound audio mixes (See Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon DVD). \n \nCategory Rock/Pop, Rock\nLabel Capitol / EMI Records \nOrig Year 2007 \nDiscs 1 \nStreet Date Jun 19, 2007 \nStudio/Live Studio \nMono/Stereo Stereo \nProducer Jack Douglas; Phil Spector; John &amp; Yoko; Yoko Ono; John Lennon \nRecording Time 72 minutes \nAdditional Info With DVD; Limited Edition \n\nTrack Listing\n   Song Title \n \n  1.
