The band consists of Thom Yorke \n(lead vocals, guitar, piano), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments),\nColin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion), and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals).\nRadiohead released their debut single &quot;Creep&quot; in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months \nafter the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom \nwith the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997),\npropelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation,\nOK Computer is often acclaimed as one of the landmark records of the 1990s\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music,\nkrautrock and jazz influences. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of piano and guitar driven rock, electronics, \nand lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. Radiohead initially self-released their seventh album In Rainbows (2007)\nas a digital download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success.\nTheir eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures, which the band released independently.\nRadiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide,with the band's work being placed highly in both listener polls and critics' lists; \nthey have the distinction of doing so in both the 1990s and 2000s.\nIn 2005, Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of &quot;The Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;\nwhile Jonny Greenwood (48th) and Ed O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists,\nand Thom Yorke (66th[6]) in their list of greatest singers.
