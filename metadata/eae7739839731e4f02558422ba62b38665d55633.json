  "description": "Hearthfire DLC Info:\nWith this official add-on to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, you can purchase land and build your own home from the ground up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from a simple one-room cottage to a sprawling compound complete with an armory, alchemy laboratory, stable, garden, and more. Use all-new tools like the drafting table and carpenterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s workbench to transform quarried stone, clay, and sawn logs into structures and furnishings. Even transform your house into a home by adopting children.\n\n\nKey features:\n\nChoose Your Land Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Choose from property in the salt marshes of Hjaalmarch, the forests of Falkreath, or the vast tundra of The Pale.
