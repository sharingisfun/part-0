Now back home in New Bordeaux, Lincoln is set on escaping a criminal past. But when his surrogate family, the black mob, is betrayed and wiped out by the Italian Mafia, Lincoln builds a new family on the ashes of the old and blazes a path of military-grade revenge through those responsible. Intense gun fights, visceral hand-to-hand combat, white knuckle driving and street smarts will all be needed. But with the right crew, tough decisions and some dirty hands, itâ€™s possible to make it to the top of the city's underworld","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8683515742f49fdf9583360161983ef57df2380","amp;dn":"Mafia+III+Update+1.01-CODEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8683515742f49fdf9583360161983ef57df2380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,104,53,21,116,47,73,253,249,88,51,96,22,25,131,239,87,223,35,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
