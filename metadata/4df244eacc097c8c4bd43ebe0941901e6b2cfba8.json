  "description": "Eric Clapton\n20th Century Masters \nMillennium Collection\nThe Best Of Eric Clapton (2004)\n\nBy the time Eric Clapton launched his solo career with the release of his self-titled debut album in mid-1970, he was long established as one of the world's major rock stars due to his group affiliations -- the Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Cream, and Blind Faith -- which had demonstrated his claim to being the best rock guitarist of his generation. That it took Clapton so long to go out on his own, however, was evidence of a degree of reticence unusual for one of his stature. And his debut album, though it spawned the Top 40 hit &quot;After Midnight,&quot; was typical of his self-effacing approach: it was, in effect, an album by the group he had lately been featured in, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.I Shot The Sheriff\n02.After Midnight\n03.Knockin' On Heaven's Door\n04.Wonderful Tonight\n05.Layla\n06.Cocaine\n07.Lay Down Sally\n08.Bell Bottom Blues\n09.Promises\n10.Let It Rain\n11.Let It Grow\n\nCheers!",
