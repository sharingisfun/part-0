Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy, and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents&amp;#x27; disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr Curt Connors, his father&amp;#x27;s former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors&amp;#x27; alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e58cfabf864c6b40012f087cfbac6ffa0e8813","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+SpiderMan+%282012%29+3D+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e58cfabf864c6b40012f087cfbac6ffa0e8813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,229,140,250,191,134,76,107,64,1,47,8,124,251,172,111,250,14,136,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
