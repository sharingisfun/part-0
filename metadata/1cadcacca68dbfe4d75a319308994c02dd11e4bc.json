Blind virtually since birth, Wonder's heightened awareness of sound helped him create vibrant, colorful music teeming with life and ambition. Nearly everything he recorded bore the stamp of his sunny, joyous positivity; even when he addressed serious racial, social, and spiritual issues (which he did quite often in his prime), or sang about heartbreak and romantic uncertainty, an underlying sense of optimism and hope always seemed to emerge. Much like his inspiration, Ray Charles, Wonder had a voracious appetite for many different kinds of music, and refused to confine himself to any one sound or style.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Superstition\n02.Sir Duke\n03.I Wish\n04.Master Blaster (Jammin')\n05.Isn't She Lovely\n06.I Just Called To Say I Love You\n07.Ebony And Ivory\n08.As\n09.Never Had A Dream Come True\n10.I Was Made To Love Her\n11.Heaven Help Us All\n12.Overjoyed\n13.Lately\n14.For Your Love\n15.If You Really Love Me\n16.Higher Ground\n17.Do I Do\n18.Living For The City\n19.Part-Time Lover\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.For Once In My Life\n02.Uptight (Everything's Alright)\n03.We Can Work It Out\n04.Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\n05.Yester-Me Yester-You Yesterday\n06.I'm Wondering\n07.My Cherie Amour\n08.You Are The Sunshine Of My Life\n09.I Don't Know Why (I Love You)\n10.A Place In The Sun\n11.Blowin' In The Wind\n12.Send One Your Love\n13.Pastime Paradise\n14.I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\n15.Fingertips (Parts 1 &amp; 2)\n16.Boogie On Reggae Woman\n17.You Haven't Done Nothin'\n18.He's Misstra Know It All\n19.Happy Birthday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
