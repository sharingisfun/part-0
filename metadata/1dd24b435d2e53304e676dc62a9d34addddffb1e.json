  "description": "Rob Zombie\nDiscography (1998-2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nThe longtime frontman for metal superstars White Zombie, Rob Zombie was born Robert Cummings on January 12, 1966, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, forming the group soon after moving to New York City circa 1985. He subsequently worked as a bike messenger, porn magazine art director, and production assistant for the classic children's TV series Pee-Wee's Playhouse, concurrently leading White Zombie through a series of cult-favorite indie releases; the success of their 1992 major-label debut, La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1, not only launched Zombie to new prominence within the music industry, but also allowed him to try his hand at animation (most notably a hallucinatory sequence of the feature Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America) and directing (he was slated to helm the third chapter of The Crow franchise, working from his own screenplay, but Miramax Films eventually pulled out of the deal).\n\n\nGenre................: Alternative metal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998-2013\nQuality..............: Mp3 CBR 320 kbps (Insane)\nIncluded.............: Covers\n\n\nDiscography:\n\n\n1998 - Hellbilly Deluxe\n\n1999 - American Made Music To Strip By\n\n2001 - The Sinister Urge\n\n2006 - Educated Horses\n\n2007 - Zombie Live\n\n2008 - New Collection (Rob Zombie &amp; White Zombie)\n\n2010 - Hellbilly Deluxe 2\n\n2012 - Mondo Sex Head (Explicit Deluxe Edition)\n\n2013 - Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...",
