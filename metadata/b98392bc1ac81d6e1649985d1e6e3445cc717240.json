  "description": "Title: University Physics with Modern Physics \r\nAuthor: Hugh D. Young, Roger A. Freedman \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 1600 pages \r\nPublisher: Addison-Wesley; 14 edition (January 9, 2015) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9780321973610 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe benchmark for clarity and rigor, influenced by the latest in education research.\r\n\r\nSince its first edition, University Physics has been revered for its emphasis on fundamental principles and how to apply them. This text is known for its clear and thorough narrative, as well as its uniquely broad, deep, and thoughtful sets of worked examples that provide students with key tools for developing both conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Edition improves the defining features of the text while adding new features influenced by education research to teach the skills needed by todayâ€™s students. A focus on visual learning, new problem types, and pedagogy informed by MasteringPhysics metadata headline the improvements designed to create the best learning resource for physics students",
