  "description": "INCLUDED CRACK ONLY IN THIS TORRENT\n\n\nPro Tools 10 software is the latest version of Avid's flagship music creation and audio production software, and delivers many great new features. \nSpeed up editing and mixing workflows with Clip Gain. \n\nWork more easily with AudioSuite-rendered clips with reverse processing handles and other new workflows.\nGet great responsiveness on slower hard drives with the enhanced disk handler. \nWork with more plug-ins and maintain total phase accuracy with 4x more Automatic Delay Compensation (16k vs. 4k in Pro Tools 9).\nCreate bigger mixes in Pro Tools HD, with higher track counts. \nAnd get over 500 new Pro Tools commands when using \nArtist Series, System 5, and other EUCON-enabled consoles.\n\n\nJust in case Avid changes the protection \n(or you get paranoid downloading from avid ) \nI made a mirror of the 10.3.9 installer available as of now, you'll find it in the peeplink.\n\nBe sure to watch the video and to read the readme.rtfd included.\n(famous Apple's text format that stands for Read The Document)\n\nThis crack is finally working, the only downside is that you must use\nthe fade tool to create fades, if you use the menu item &quot;Create Fades&quot;\nor the shortcut cmd+F it crashes, so don't try, btw the fade tool\nis the easiest and fastest way to create fades in PT so you should use that anyway.\n\nRemember to enable Access to Assistive Devices,\nI forgot it in the video, btw in the readme is clearly explained.\n\n\n\nFix Notes:\nMany people faced problem with the previous patch+loader,\nI made a mistake to share it on the wave of enthusiasm,\nit was in a too early stage and not fully working.\n\nNow we think this can be declared a final crack,\nopenssh spotted the pseudo-random iLok checks and circumvented the CRC checks, \nit's now totally usable unlike the previous partial crack.\nThe new loader should be fool-proof. Just follow instructions.\n\nReversing and patch scripting by openssh.\nLoader applet by copylefter.",
