  "description": "Code Orange - Orange Aint The New Black (2-CD Compilation) 2016 320ak\r\n\r\nCode Orange (formerly Code Orange Kids is an American hardcore punk band that formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2008. The band signed to Deathwish Inc. and have since released two studio albums through the label: Love Is Love/Return to Dust (2012) and I Am King (2014). In 2012, three of the band's members â€“ Reba Meyers, Jami Morgan and Joe Goldman â€“ formed the rock band Adventures.\r\n\r\nThe band described themselves as &quot;doomy, abrasive&quot; hardcore punk similar to Black Flag, Converge or Integrity. The band found some difficulty touring in their early days. Because all the members went to various high schools in Pennsylvania, they were not old enough to play at some of the clubs and could only tour between semesters. Despite this, Code Orange Kids opened for such bands as the Misfits, The Bronx, Nekromantix and Anti-Flag.\r\nCode Orange's first tour in support of I Am King was a six-date stint with Killswitch Engage surrounding the band's participation in This is Hardcore Festival 2014 in July/August 2014, followed by a North American co-headlining tour with Twitching Tongues in September and October. \r\nIn a review of their 2014 album I Am King, Ryan Bray of Consequence of Sound placed them within the &quot;American metalcore underground&quot; and noted that their music stood out in exhibiting influences not just from hardcore and metal but also from indie rock, post-punk and shoegaze. In 2015, Brian Leak of Alternative Press celebrated them as being &quot;at the top of their game, not to mention the hardcore scene&quot;. They also appeared on 2015's Mayhem Festival, and toured the U.S. from June to August.\r\n\r\nCode Orange signed to Roadrunner Records for their third studio album, tentatively due out in late 2016. Leading up to the new album's release, the band will tour the U.S. with Deftones in May 2016 and perform sporadic mid-year festival dates, including This Is Hardcore in August.\r\n\r\nFormat: mp3\r\nBitrate: 320ak\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nCD-1 Time 32:28\r\n\r\n\r\n01 I Am King.mp3\r\n02 Slowburn.mp3\r\n03 Dreams in Inertia.mp3\r\n04 Unclean Spirit.mp3\r\n05 Alone in a Room.mp3\r\n06 My World.mp3\r\n07 Starve.mp3\r\n08 Your Body Is Ready....mp3\r\n09 Thinners of the Herd.mp3\r\n10 Bind You.mp3\r\n11 Mercy.mp3\r\n\r\nCD-2 Time 27:13 \r\n\r\n\r\n01 - Flowermouth (The Leech).mp3\r\n02 - Around My Neck  On My Head.mp3\r\n03 - Sleep (I've Been Slipping).mp3\r\n04 - Liars  Trudge.mp3\r\n05 - Colors (Into Nothing).mp3\r\n06 - Nothing (The Rat).mp3\r\n07 - Roots Are Certain  Sky Is Empty.mp3\r\n08 - Choices (Love Is Love).mp3\r\n09 - Calm  Breathe.mp3\r\n10 - Bloom (Return To Dust).mp3\r\n\r\nMembers\r\nCurrent\r\n\r\n    Eric Balderose â€“ guitar, vocals\r\n    Reba Meyers â€“ guitar, vocals\r\n    Jami Morgan â€“ drums, vocals\r\n    Joe Goldman â€“ bass\r\n\r\n\t\r\nFormer\r\n\r\n    Bob Rizzo â€“ guitar\r\n    Greg Kern â€“ guitar\r\n\r\nSo be looking for them.
