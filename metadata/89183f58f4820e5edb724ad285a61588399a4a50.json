  "description": "For those who are interested in the Academic version of Prepar3D v3.0 (Full Install).\r\n\r\nThe Academic version is the &quot;Only&quot; Prepar3D version that is planned on supporting the PMDG Product(s) at the moment\r\n\r\nthey (PMDG) specifically stated that PMDG products currently only licensed for personal use/Students version of P3D and have not yet reached an agreement with their partners, licensing their products to the professional market (Pro &amp; Pro-Plus versions of Prepar3D)\r\n\r\nthere are other vendors that will follow PMDG's footstep that will license their product for Personal learning/Students and not for the Professional version/market. hemce those products might be limited only to work on the Academic version of Prepar3D.\r\n\r\nThose vendors who are planning on releasing &quot;two&quot; versions of their product, one for personal use and the other for the professional market, hefty price is expected on the version that will work on the Pro/Pro-plus. by installing the Pro version you are potentially limiting yourself to the more expensive License/cost of 3rd party tools. The Academic version on the other hand, all 3rd party addons will be much cheaper and yet with the same exact functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrack is Included....\r\n\r\nThanks to @KACE321 for providing the Crack",
