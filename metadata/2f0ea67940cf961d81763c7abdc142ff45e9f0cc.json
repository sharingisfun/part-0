A self-taught guitarist, he began his career as a musician playing for other successful singers of the 1970s.\n\nHis striking debut in the Italian music world was in 1977 with the album Terra mia, which proved to be a successful mix of Neapolitan tradition and Blues sounds. Daniele defined his music with the term &quot;taramblu&quot;, which indicated a mix of tarantella, blues and rumba. His lyrics also attracted critical praise: written and sung in an intense Neapolitan, they contained strong though bitter accusations against the social injustices of Naples, as well as Italian society in general, and included melancholic personal themes. Several of the later songs are characterized by a free intermingling of English, Italian and Neapolitan passages.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f0ea67940cf961d81763c7abdc142ff45e9f0cc","amp;dn":"Pino+Daniele+-+Terra+Mia%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f0ea67940cf961d81763c7abdc142ff45e9f0cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,14,166,121,64,207,150,29,129,118,60,122,189,193,66,255,69,233,240,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
