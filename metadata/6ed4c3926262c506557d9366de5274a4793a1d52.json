  "description": "Family Photo Album Slideshow - Videohive Project files [After Effects]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8yNB5Xh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8yNB5Xh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo: http://videohive.net/item/family-photo-album-slideshow/679987\n\nThis project, completed entirely inside After Effects (no prerendered 3d), is perfect for showcasing all your family photos. From pictures of your ancestors up to your most recent precious moments, this project will showcase all your memories in a sentimental light. The length of this video can be adjusted to whatever you need, from 5 seconds up to nearly 20 minutes. With up to 158 shots and far more image placeholders than I care to count, you will have no shortage of places to put your images. Each shot has 3 instances, most with unique camera moves.\n\nIncluded features:\n\n-Full 1920Ãƒâ€”1080 HD\n\n-Video Tutorial\n\n-Includes numerous shots that were not included in the preview video.\n\n-Almost all shots with framed photos include; landscape, portrait, and square versions.\n\n-Shots can be added, removed, rearranged or lengthened. So you can easily setup the project with only the shots you want to use.\n\n-Since it was created entirely in AE, all aspects can be changed, including the addition or removal of background objects (i.e. maps, flag, penant, etcÃ¢â‚¬Â¦) or the adjustment of camera moves and timing. This makes it easy to adjust the style to match the look you are going for.\n\n-No plugins needed (Optical Flares version is included for those who want it.)\n\n-All background elements are included (i.e. maps, flag, penant, etcÃ¢â‚¬Â¦)\n",
