  "description": "    There once was a man who lived a life so strange it had to be true. Only he could see what no one else canÃ¢â‚¬â€the darkness inside. The real monster within. And he's the one who must stop them. This is his calling. This is his duty. This is the life of a Grimm.\n    Grimm is about the fairy tales that you have heard before bedtime comes to life when Detective Nick Burhardt (David Giuntoli ) thought that moving to Portland, Oregon was a good idea. It was until he started seeing things he couldn't explain such as normal beautiful women turning into hags or a normal man turning into a troll. Nick goes to his relative in the hospital who tells him that he has the Grimm, a supernatural power that is able to see the creatures in real life. With his partner Lt. Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) the pair track down a killer in a &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; tale.\n    Now the tales of the Brothers Grimm comes to life in this new thriller and no one is safe. Only Nick can restore the town to what it was before. Created by David Greenwalt (Angel, Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Jim Kouf (Angel, National Treasure), Grimm is a new fresh idea that takes you into a world of the supernatural right in your own home.",
