  "description": "\nThe Endless River is the upcoming fifteenth studio album by British progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Produced by David Gilmour, Youth, Andy Jackson and Phil Manzanera, the album is scheduled to be released by Parlophone and Columbia Records respectively in Friday-release countries on 7 November 2014 and in the United Kingdom on 10 November 2014. The album is the band's first since the death of keyboardist and founding member Richard Wright, who appears posthumously, and the third by the Gilmour-led Pink Floyd after Roger Waters' departure from the band in 1985. The Endless River is the first studio release by the band to be distributed by Parlophone and Warner Bros. Records, following the purchase of EMI and its assets by the Universal Music Group in 2012, their transfer to Parlophone and the purchase of Parlophone by Warner Bros. in 2013.\n\nDescribed as a &quot;swan song&quot; for Wright, The Endless River mostly comprises instrumental, ambient music. It is based on twenty hours of unreleased material the band wrote, recorded and produced with Wright during sessions for Pink Floyd's previous studio album The Division Bell in 1994. The album was finished aboard the Astoria, Gilmour's houseboat recording studio, in 2013 and 2014 and at David's other home studio called Medina Studios in Hove, Brighton, England. Information about the album was leaked via social media, after which Pink Floyd made a formal announcement. News of the impending release was positively received, whereas the record itself was later met with a mixed reception.\n\nThe band, Parlophone and Columbia Records (outside Europe) launched a promotional campaign in the lead-up to its release with television advertisements and installations of the album artwork placed in cities around the world, including London, New York, Paris, Berlin and Milan. The cover concept is by Ahmed Emad Eldin with sleeve design by Stylorouge. Aubrey Powell served as creative director for the artwork.\nCode\nRecording Line-up:\n\n\n\n  - David Gilmour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, vocals, keyboards, bass guitar\n   \n  - Nick Mason Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\n   \n  - Richard Wright Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hammond organ, piano, keyboards, synthesiser, pipe organ\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n  1.
