  "description": "Togainu no Chi\nCompany: Nitro+Chiral\nRelease date: Feb 25, 2005\nGenre: Otome Game/ BL Game\n\nSummary: After being devastated in the third World War (known as The Third Division), Japan was divided in two. Several years after the end of the war, a crime organization called Vischio has taken control of the destroyed city of Toshima (formerly Tokyo, Japan's capital city), where they are holding a battle game known as &quot;Igura&quot;. The game's main character, a young man named Akira, is falsely accused of a crime. Once arrested, a mysterious woman appears before him, offering him freedom if he agrees to participate in Igura and defeat Igura's strongest man: the king, or &quot;Il re&quot;. The story follows Akira's life in the harsh, lawless Toshima as he fights both to survive and to unravel the mysteries developing around him. \n\n\nIf you play translated visual novels in English - visit fuwanovel.org             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&lt;/a&gt;          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/89&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/89&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote: No installation required\t",
