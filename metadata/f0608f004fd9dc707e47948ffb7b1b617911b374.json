The establishment was abandoned long ago, but recently restored under the program &quot;Research and charity&quot; Transnational corporations Murkoff. So far, all in the hospital took place in complete secrecy ...   Acting on a tip from an internal source, independent journalist Miles Apshur enters the hospital. What he finds there - beyond the pale of science and religion, nature and something completely different. Once inside, Miles hopes only for one thing - to shed light on all the horrifying truth hidden in the heart of Mount Massive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0608f004fd9dc707e47948ffb7b1b617911b374","amp;dn":"Outlast+%28MULTi6%29+RePack+By+R.G+Mechanics+NASWARI%2BZOHAIB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0608f004fd9dc707e47948ffb7b1b617911b374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,96,143,0,79,217,220,112,126,71,148,143,251,123,27,97,121,17,179,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
