  "description": "Ghost Whisperer is an American television supernatural drama, which ran on CBS from September 23, 2005 to May 21, 2010.[2]\n\nThe series follows the life of Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. While trying to live as normal a life as possibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½she is married and owns an antique storeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Melinda helps earthbound spirits resolve their problems and cross over into the light, or the spirit world. Her tasks are difficult and at times she struggles with people who push her away and disbelieve her ability. In addition, the ghosts are mysterious and sometimes menacing in the beginning and Melinda must use the clues available to her to understand the spirits' needs and help them.[3] The show was created by John Gray and was produced by Sander/Moses Productions, executive producer, and Jennifer Love Hewitt in association with ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.[4] On May 18, 2010, CBS canceled the show after five seasons.
