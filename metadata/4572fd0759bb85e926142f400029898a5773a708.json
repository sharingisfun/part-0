Set in the 24th century from the year 2371 through 2378, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS Voyager, which becomes stranded in the Delta Quadrant 70,000 light-years from Earth while pursuing a renegade Maquis ship. Both ships' crews merge aboard Voyager to make the estimated 75-year journey home.\n\nThe show was created by Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor and is the fourth incarnation of Star Trek, which began with the 1960s series Star Trek, created by Gene Roddenberry. It was produced for seven seasons, from 1995 to 2001, and is the only Star Trek series with a female captain, Kathryn Janeway, as a lead character.\n\nVoyager aired on UPN and was the network's second longest-running series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4572fd0759bb85e926142f400029898a5773a708","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Voyager+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6+%26+7+%2B+Extras+DVDRip+TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4572fd0759bb85e926142f400029898a5773a708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,114,253,7,89,187,133,233,38,20,47,64,0,41,137,138,87,115,167,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
