(Oof. Here we go again.)  I'm  a  mercenary  with  an\naccelerated healing factor. I've been described as unstable, which is just\nplain coo-coo. (Wait, do sane people say coo-coo?) I'm  gonna  battle  for\nthe safety of humans and mutants. (And even mumans.) Be prepared for  just\nabout anything. (Holla!)\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* I made sure to capture all my good sides, so I made my game a\n third-person action-shooter. (Yep, you get to look at my heinie.)\n* Keep a look out cuz some of my X-Men pals (Whoa, what pals?!) are making\n an appearance. (Hope you don't mind picking hair out of your tacos.)\n* I'm really good at killing, so I made it a blast stringing together\n combos, and totally eviscerating my enemies. (Ev-is-cer-a-ting!)\n* I brought my skills and a buttload of my favorite things. Katanas\n (check), guns (bang!) explosives (boom), duct tape (quack) and of\n course, yours truly - ME! (Checkmate!)\n\n\nInstallation Information:\n\n* Burn or mount\n* Install\n* Play the game\n\nNOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\n*****UPLOADER NOTE README*****\n\nThis is the story of the my previous deadpool uploaded torrent: When my seedbox i use for games only\nis dead or have low speed/etc (it's a donated one not buyed by me) i use my other resources like\nsome private torrent sites with dht/peer exchange set OFF/not a private torrent and i usually \ndownload them to check for viruses and help with the seeding even this had same size and was posted on\na very trusted private and popular site but 5 days ago when i uploaded this torrent i was in a rush\nand it had a bitcoin or something like this virus on iso file...when i returned to home my internet conection\nwas dead...big storm, all network was repaired etc etc and for 5 days nobody did have connection to internet\nso i've just hear about this problem...all i can say it's that original uploader from that private site\nwas banned forever since it's the second time he did this, it's not my fault but it's my responsability.\nI hope all who downloaded this game and got infected will forgive me...you can remove it with a good av\nlike eset updated or malwarebytes. Anyway sorry about this and i take all responsability for not test it\nbut as i say'd i didn't have connection for 5 days. I will not upload any games out in this 5 days period\nbecause i have lots to do software and hardware on my pc/seedbox or personal things. I will upload games\nreleased from today. THANKS to all users who send emails or pm's to report this, also to admins/mods who remove\nit before me. I hope you all continue to download my uploaded games from now and we will be again one big family.\nIf you had a good av like eset that virus will be removed and play the previous infected release,\nif not this is safe and you can download it again.\n\n\nNote: We need anything you can offer as early releases,seedboxes,links,accounts,etc\nplease contact us on piratepedia[@]gmail.com or our website torentz 3xforum ro\nSeed Stats: 20-400 GiB at aprox 10 MiB/sec/20 slots per torrent\n\nDeadpool-FLT Torrent Free Download\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7/0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHow To Get Your MAXSPEED (uTorrent)\n\nTorrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each \nTorrent Client - Preferences - BiTorrent - Protocol Encryption - Forced\nBandwidth Allocation - High (Set download/upload limit - Unlimited)\nStop Other Active Torrents - Start downloading and wait for connections.\nEnjoy and Seed for at least 1:1 ratio.
