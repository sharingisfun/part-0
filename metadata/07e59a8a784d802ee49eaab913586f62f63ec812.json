Now he is forced to travel the globe to complete three impossible assassinations, and do what he does best, make them look like accidents.\r\n\r\nDirector: Dennis Gansel\r\nWriters: Philip Shelby (screenplay), Tony Mosher (screenplay)\r\nStars: Jason Statham, Jessica Alba, Tommy Lee Jones \r\nGenres: Action | Crime | Thriller\r\nCountry: France | USA\r\nLanguage: English | Bulgarian\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: AVC 1752kbps 720x304 23.976fps\r\nAudio: MP3 2.0 Digital Audio\r\nLanguage: English\r\nSubtitles: Has hardcoded English subs for foreign parts\r\nSource: Cinezine site thx\r\nSample: included\r\nEncoder: CPG\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3522806/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbravo on folks who tag this as HDTS before or DVDScr-HDTS lmao...\r\nFirst what is it? since we don't have the source so best judgement will be someone WAS having SCR of this and he don't know how to remove DVD protection So he cammed the print using his old ass phone while movie was playing on screen. if you are reading this please understand that watermark you captured on screener is a actually form of a  tracker.\r\nwhy i did not crop? well movie re-encoded and shared more times then any recent movie so whats the point..\r\n\r\nNow this is a definition of CAM print. i don't know how you even think this is HDTS its quiet ************** anyways...........\r\nNow video is not great even worse then last source we had of War Dogs but its clear and enjoyable on small screen. CAM recorded audio was not good, so instead of using the cam audio we simply replaced that with Proper Line Audio so you can actually enjoy this. and thats the only reason for this entire readnfo lol\r\ndid not touch video much expect few things here n there..\r\nSample included! have a look at it first.. Always Believe in 3 words -&gt; CPG\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wqGw \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wqG2 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wqGN \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wqGT \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wqGj \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wqGn",
