  "description": "Acronis Backup Advanced v11.5.43916 Bootable ISO - [FirstUploads]\n\n\nAcronis Backup Advanced delivers best-in-class protection for your entire environment, regardless of your setup: physical servers, virtual machines, workstations, or all of the above. All products in the suite deliver the fastest, most efficient backup and recovery available. When disaster strikes, recover an entire serverÃ¢â‚¬â€with all data intactÃ¢â‚¬â€in minutes! You can also restore files, folders, and applications to any location in record time. Thanks to Acronis AnyData technology, all products in the suite can work alone, or combine seamlessly under a single management console. The result? Customizable solutions with room for future growth.\n\nDisk Image Technology\nDisk-level snapshots save complete images of a disk or volume in one simple step (including the operating system, applications, and data). This technology works for both physical and virtual machines.\n\nCentralized Management\nOur unified dashboard lets you manage all backup operations for both physical and virtual machines from a single, central location. Assign backup plans to one or more machines, review status updates, and receive alertsÃ¢â‚¬â€all from one console!\n\nBusiness Applications Protection\nOur patented disk image technology enables consistent backup of running applications. This allows you to backup Exchange , SQL Server, SharePoint, and Active Directory data as you work. Granular application data may be restored without taking systems offline, protecting your business from expensive downtime.\n\nCompression and Deduplication\nDeduplication can be run on either the source or target side to minimize data movement and maximize utilization of storage and network infrastructure. This helps reduce storage costs and minimizes network load.\n\nMultiple Backup Destinations\nStore your backups in up to 5 different locations to ensure more flexible, reliable recovery. Combine local disks, attached storage, tape, network storage, and/or cloud locations to minimize your storage costs and provide multiple recovery options in the case of disaster",
