Moving rather than maudlin, uplifting rather than depressing. Instrumental 1, all strings and brass and piano, is like the overture to a David Lean epic, not least because it leads straight into the mighty, hot-stepping, choir-driven Love Of An Orchestra.\nThis is the love song that I write while still in love with you, Fink sings over booming drums, and more choral backing vocals oh the standout Blue Skies. Next to the irresistible-yet-twee-ish indie-pop of last year's Top 10 summer hit 5 Years, he's upped his game quicksmart.\nImpressionistic symphonic-pop maestro Sufjan Stevens, back this autumn with a new album, had better watch his back. Here is a song-painter blessed with huge talent.\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb80a823e0a9125540fbf5eef5883e8aab872d3c","amp;dn":"Noah+And+The+Whale+-+The+First+Days+Of+Spring+%5Bmp3-320-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb80a823e0a9125540fbf5eef5883e8aab872d3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,128,168,35,224,169,18,85,64,251,245,238,245,136,62,138,171,135,45,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
