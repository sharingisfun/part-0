  "description": "MAD MAX 3 - BEYOND THUNDERDOME - 1985\n\nIMDb Rating: 5.8\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089530/\n\nThe third film in the Mad Max trilogy.\n\n  In MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME, Max is left alone to &quot;die&quot; in the desert. He makes his way through and comes to Bartertown, a city of last resort that has been able to maintain some of the technological capabilities of our former civilization. Bartertown might have been influenced by old Western bordertowns, but it reminded me of a poor-persons version of Mos Eisly from STAR WARS. Anyway, Max finds himself in the middle of a power struggle in the town and ends up fighting in a Coliseum like place called the Thunderdome, but people in Bartertown don't fight fair and after the fight Max is banished from the city into the desert. There he is found by a group of orphaned children who believe he is the pilot of their plane that crashed many years ago. Some of the children believe it is time to leave and return to their true home and they follow Max, but before they can return to their place of origin, they have to go through Bartertown.\n\n  Starring: Mel Gibson, Tina Turner, Bruce Spence, Adam Cockburn, Frank Thring.\n\n  Directed  by: George Ogilvie, George Miller.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr. 47min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x  304\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps",
