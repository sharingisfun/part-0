  "description": "\nStephen Neale, Lisa Spencer-Arnell, Liz Wilson, &quot;Emotional Intelligence Coaching: Improving Performance for Leaders, Coaches and the Individual&quot;\nEnglish | 2009 | ISBN: 074945458X | 244 pages | PDF | 1,3 MB\n\nEmotional Intelligence Coaching examines how emotions and habits can impact performance. Emotional intelligence can help coaches recognize how attitudes -- both their own and their clients' -- prevent people from reaching their potential and how to replace them with more useful attitudes, feelings and thoughts. The authors present the various models and tools that coaches can use to help them become more emotionally intelligent when coaching.\n\nThe book explains the basic principles of emotional intelligence and how these relate to coaching for performance. It includes practical activities for coaching, as well as interviews with coaches who use emotional intelligence as part of their coaching strategy.",
