  "description": "Tracklist:\n1 - Hold On, Be Strong\n2 - Return of the G\n3 - Rosa Parks\n4 - Skew It on the Bar-B\n5 - Aquemini\n6 - Synthesizer - George Clinton\n7 - Slump\n8 - West Savannah\n9 - Art of Storytellin' (Pt. 1)\n10 - Art of Storytellin' (Pt. 2)\n11 - Mamacita\n12 - Spottieottiedopaliscious\n13 - Y'all Scared - Big Gipp\n14 - Nathaniel\n15 - Liberation - C-Lo\n16 - Chonkyfire\n\nIt takes a few listens to sink in, but on Aquemini, Outkast have pulled off a rare feat in hip-hop: they've made a good record that's a masterpiece of subtlety. What's more, it's their third record, and they've yet to fall into a rut--and that alone puts them in line for an award. The Organized Noize production crew is sublime, working with live musicians and crafting hook-filled soundscapes that complement Big Boi and Andre Benjamin's melodic patter. (See Rosa Parks, Chonkyfire, and the epic Liberation, which features Erykah Badu, Cee Lo, and Big Rube--and clocks in at just under nine minutes.) Classy and intelligent, Outkast haven't sacrificed anything in their quest to make challenging, innovative hip-hop that forgoes idle boasting for the duo's message. A sample, from the title track: Now, question: Is every nigga wit dreads for the cause? / Is every nigga wit golds for the fall? Naw / So don't get caught in appearance.",
