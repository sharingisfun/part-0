Violin virtuoso and notorious womanizer Niccolo Paganini (David Garrett) is at the peak of his career, acclaimed throughout Europe.

Business-savvy Urbani ultimately manages to bring Paganini to the British capital, albeit against his will.

She and the violinist find the way to each other's hearts through music - and Paganini falls undyingly in love with the young beauty.
