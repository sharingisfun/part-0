Ã¢â‚¬Å“People just gravitated to it, always remarking how it was their favorite.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Felix JaehnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2014 remix added to the combustible nature of the track,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but by deftly imbuing acoustic gestures into the mix Ã¢â‚¬â€œ conga, piano, trumpet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ embellishing its unornamented feel. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I loved the mix even before it took off,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Omi. Ã¢â‚¬Å“So calm; And unusual for a remix, it made you want to listen to the words, too.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nsingle mp3 song","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009850fc6f99b3e614416e7e81b8776352a6e197","amp;dn":"OMI+-+Cheerleader+%28Felix+Jaehn+Remix%29+%5BOfficial+Video%5D.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009850fc6f99b3e614416e7e81b8776352a6e197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,152,80,252,111,153,179,230,20,65,110,126,129,184,119,99,82,166,225,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
