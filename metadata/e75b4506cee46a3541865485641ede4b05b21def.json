Skyscraper\n\nQuote:\nJulian Plenty - is the alter ego of Paul Banks, guitarist, vocalist and main lyricist of Interpol. His solo work is still the same interpolovsky post-punk, but perhaps a little different perspective, and very very dilute chamber attacks. According to the musician, the album sounds &quot;bold and sexy,&quot; &quot;My music is similar to Interpol, spevshihsya to BeirutÃ‚Â». Banks writes under the name of Plenty for several years, so the album will include both newly composed songs and a few tracks, made 10 years ago. How wonderful it is said in the review of the Clash Music: Ã‚Â«This collection of eleven great songs that will annoy and inspire at the same time, its charming mix of loans from different musical directions.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75b4506cee46a3541865485641ede4b05b21def","amp;dn":"Interpol+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75b4506cee46a3541865485641ede4b05b21def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,91,69,6,206,228,106,53,65,134,84,133,100,30,222,75,5,178,29,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
