Its in bad shape. Binding is gone, pages are loose &amp; discolored, some are eaten up. I wanted to preserve it in digital format, so with great effort &amp; difficulty, I managed to scan it over 10 days. And I am sharing it for the benefit of all German learners. It has lots of illustrations &amp; B&amp;W photos. I have OCRed it in both languages. Also added chapterwise bookmarks. Hope you like the scan quality.
