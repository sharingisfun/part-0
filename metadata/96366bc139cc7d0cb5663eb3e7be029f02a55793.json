Along the Atlantic coastline,\n a monster has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea\n city of Rapture. Players step into the boots of the most iconic denizen of Rapture,\n the Big Daddy, as they travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city,\n chasing an unseen foe in search of answers and their own survival. \n \n Minerva's Den DLC:\n ==================\n \n Minerva's Den offers a brand-new, self-contained BioShock story, presenting a\n side of Rapture you've never seen before. Seek out the tools you'll need to \n unlock new goals and spaces in the order you choose. Face Rapture's full range\n of opposition as you increase in power---a new challenge is always right around \n the corner. Expand your combat abilities with the experimental Ion Laser and \n chaotic Gravity Well Plasmid, unique to Minerva's Den. Face off against the\n new Lancer Big Daddy, the most advanced Protector that Rapture ever produced. \n Explore every shadowy corner of Minerva's Den, unraveling the mysterious past\n of The Thinker's inventor, and the dark secrets hidden within the unfeeling,\n omniscient machine he created.\n \n The Protector Trials DLC:\n =========================\n \n The Protector Trials: You receive the call: Tenenbaum desperately needs you to\n steal as much ADAM as possible, to help thwart Sofia Lamb's insane plan. Enter \n the Protector Trials: frantic combat challenges designed to push your mastery \n of weapons and Plasmids to the limit. The goal in each Trial is simple: get your\n Little Sister to an ADAM-rich corpse and keep her safe while she gathers precious\n ADAM. Opposition mounts as your Little Sister nears her goal -- will you survive \n the onslaught? Each Trial features three unique weapon and Plasmid load-outs,\n keeping the challenge fresh, as well as a fourth bonus load-out the player receives\n when all previous load-outs are completed\n\n\n ***************************** \n**   **Install Notes:**      **\n ***************************** \n \n1.
