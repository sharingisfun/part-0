The first single, 'The Fear', is somewhat heavier in tone thanprevious singles such as 'LDN' and 'Smile', and sees Allen dealing with notions of modern celebrity, a theme that continually crops up on the album. Allen also confronts politicalissues on this markedly more adult album than its predecessor, perhaps intentionally preparing a more mature image for the future.\n\n",
