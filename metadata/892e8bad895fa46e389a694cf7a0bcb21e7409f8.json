Military discipline rules. Its security systems are unmatched. None of its prisoners dream of escaping. They know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible.\n\nUntil now.\n\nJohn PullerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older brother, Robert, was convicted of treason and national security crimes. His inexplicable escape from prison makes him the most wanted criminal in the country. Some in the government believe that John Puller represents their best chance at capturing Robert alive, and so Puller takes on the burden of bringing his brother in to face justice.\n\nBut Puller quickly discovers that there are others pursuing his brother, who only see Robert as a traitor and are unconcerned if he survives. Puller is in turn pushed into an uneasy, fraught partnership with another agent, who may have an agenda of her own.\n\nThey dig more deeply into the case together, and Puller finds that not only are her allegiances unclear, but that there are troubling details about his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convictionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.and that someone is out there who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want the truth to ever come to light. As the nationwide manhunt for Robert grows more urgent, PullerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterful skills as an investigator and strength as a fighter may not be enough to save his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â€or himself.\n\nepub and mobi. enjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:892e8bad895fa46e389a694cf7a0bcb21e7409f8","amp;dn":"The+Escape+%28John+Puller+%23+3%29+By+David+Baldacci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"892e8bad895fa46e389a694cf7a0bcb21e7409f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,46,139,173,137,95,164,110,56,154,105,76,247,160,188,178,30,116,9,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
