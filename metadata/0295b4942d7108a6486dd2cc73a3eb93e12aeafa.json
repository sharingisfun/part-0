For chemists to accept the idea that environmental quality and economic prosperity can be intertwined, the concept of the food-energy-water nexus must first be integrated into underlying thought processes. Food, Energy and Water: The Chemistry Connection provides todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scientists with the background information necessary to fully understand the inextricable link between food, energy and water and how this conceptual framework should form the basis for all contemporary research and development in chemistry in particular, and the sciences in general.\n\nPresents a clear, quantitative explanation of the link between food, energy, and water\nProvides information not currently available in chemistry curricula or synthesized in existing resources\nExamines the challenges of the food-energy-water nexus from a chemistry perspective within a multi-disciplinary domain\nIncludes the latest research on critical topics such as fracking, water use conflicts, and sustainability in food production cycles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0295b4942d7108a6486dd2cc73a3eb93e12aeafa","amp;dn":"Food%2C+Energy+and+Water+-+The+Chemistry+Connection+-+1st+Ed+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0295b4942d7108a6486dd2cc73a3eb93e12aeafa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,149,180,148,45,113,8,166,72,109,210,204,115,163,235,147,225,42,234,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
