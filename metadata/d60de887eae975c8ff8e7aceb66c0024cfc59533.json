  "description": "Smashing Pumpkins\nGreatest Hits (2001)\n\n\n\nOf all the major alternative rock bands of the early '90s, Smashing Pumpkins were the group least influenced by traditional underground rock. Lead guitarist/songwriter Billy Corgan fashioned an amalgam of progressive rock, heavy metal, goth rock, psychedelia, and dream pop, creating a layered, powerful sound driven by swirling, distorted guitars. Corgan was wise enough to exploit his angst-ridden lyrics, yet he never shied away from rock star posturing, even if he did cloak it in allegedly ironic gestures. In fact, Smashing Pumpkins became the model for alternative rock success. Nirvana were too destructive and Pearl Jam shunned success. The Pumpkins, on the other hand, knew how to play the game, signing to a major-subsidized indie for underground credibility and moving to the major in time to make the group a multi-platinum act. And when the Pumpkins did achieve mass success with 1993's Siamese Dream, they went a long way to legitimize heavy metal and orchestrated prog rock, helping move alternative rock even closer to '70s AOR, especially in the eyes of radio programmers and mainstream audiences. Unlike many of their contemporaries, they were able to withstand many internal problems and keep selling records, emerging as the longest-lasting and most successful alternative band of the early '90s.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Siva\n02.Rhinoceros\n03.Drown\n04.Cherub Rock\n05.Today\n06.Disarm\n07.Landslide\n08.Bullet With Butterfly Wings\n09.1979\n10.Zero\n11.Tonight, Tonight\n12.Eye\n13.Ava Adore\n14.Perfect\n15.The Everlasting Gaze\n16.Stand Inside Your Love\n17.Real Love\n18.Untitled\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Lucky 13\n02.Aeroplane Flies High\n03.Because You Are\n04.Slow Dawn\n05.Believe\n06.My Mistake\n07.Marquis In Spades\n08.Here's To The Atom Bomb\n09.Sparrow\n10.Waiting\n11.Saturnine\n12.Rock On\n13.Set The Ray To Jerry\n14.Winterlong\n15.Soot And Stars\n16.Blissed And Gone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n",
