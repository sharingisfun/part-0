  "description": "Hammerfall - Evolution  mp3  320k    2014 What we got....     r)Evolution is the ninth studio album by the band HammerFall. It is due to be released on August 27, 2014 in Sweden, August 29 in mainland Europe, September 1 in the UK and September 2 in North America. It is their second album produced by James Michael and the HammerFall guitarists Oscar Dronjak and Pontus Norgren..Early days (1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1996)\n\nHammerFall was formed when guitarist Oscar Dronjak quit Ceremonial Oath and invited Jesper StrÃƒÂ¶mblad (from In Flames) to join him as a drummer in a new musical project he had been contemplating for some time. Dronjak had already composed the song &quot;Steel Meets Steel,&quot; which was later included on HammerFall's debut album. Dronjak and StrÃƒÂ¶mblad were later joined by guitarist Niklas Sundin, bassist Johan Larsson, and vocalist Mikael Stanne. When Niklas Sundin and Johan Larsson left HammerFall the following year, Glenn LjungstrÃƒÂ¶m (then guitarist of In Flames) and Fredrik Larsson (bassist of the former Swedish death metal band Dispatched), replaced them.\nJoacim Cans joined the band in 1996\n\nAll five members played in other bands at the time. Dronjak and Larsson played in Crystal Age; StrÃƒÂ¶mblad and LjungstrÃƒÂ¶m played in In Flames and Stanne sang for Dark Tranquillity. Both of these bands influenced Swedish melodic death metal. HammerFall was relegated to being a side project of them all for several years. Their concerts were limited mostly to a local music contest named Rockslaget. The band had few songs of their own and played mostly covers from bands such as Pretty Maids, Judas Priest and Alice Cooper.\n\nIn 1996, HammerFall reached the semi-finals of Rockslaget. When Mikael Stanne could not perform with the band in the semi-finals, they found Joacim Cans, who agreed to play with them for the night. The concert was a success although the judges disqualified HammerFall for the finals. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Track listing\n    2 Personnel\n    3 Production Personnel\n    4 References\n    5 External links\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Hector's Hymn&quot;   \t  \t5:52\n2. \t&quot;(r)Evolution&quot;   \t  \t4:23\n3. \t&quot;Bushido&quot;   \t  \t4:39\n4. \t&quot;Live Life Loud&quot;   \t  \t3:30\n5. \t&quot;Ex Inferis&quot;   \t  \t4:39\n6. \t&quot;We Won't Back Down&quot;   \t  \t4:17\n7. \t&quot;Winter Is Coming&quot;   \t  \t3:47\n8. \t&quot;Origins&quot;   \t  \t4:56\n9. \t&quot;Tainted Metal&quot;   \t  \t4:35\n10. \t&quot;Evil Incarnate&quot;   \t  \t4:34\n11. \t&quot;Wildfire&quot;   \t  \t4:03\n[show]Bonus tracks \t\nPersonnel\n\n    Joacim Cans - lead and backing vocals\n    Oscar Dronjak - rhythm, lead guitars, keyboards and backing vocals, production\n    Pontus Norgren - rhythm, lead guitars and backing vocals, production\n    Fredrik Larsson - bass guitar and backing vocals\n    Anders Johansson - drums\n\n    Glory to the Brave (1997)\n    Legacy of Kings (1998)\n    Renegade (2000)\n    Crimson Thunder (2002)\n    Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken (2005)\n    Threshold (2006)\n    No Sacrifice, No Victory (2009)\n    Infected (2011)\n    (r)Evolution (2014)\nThere you have it  now for some seeders......",
