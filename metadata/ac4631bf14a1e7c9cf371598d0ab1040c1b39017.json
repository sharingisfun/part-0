It's a book of design patterns that describe simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design....Once you understand the design patterns and have had an &quot;Aha!&quot; (and not just a &quot;Huh?&quot; experience with them, you won't ever think about \nobject-oriented design in the same way. You'll have insights that can make your own designs more flexible, modular, reusable, and understandable--which is why you're interested in object-oriented technology in the first place, right?",
