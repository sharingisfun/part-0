It's a book of design patterns that describe simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design....Once you understand the design patterns and have had an &quot;Aha!&quot; (and not just a &quot;Huh?&quot; experience with them, you won't ever think about \nobject-oriented design in the same way. You'll have insights that can make your own designs more flexible, modular, reusable, and understandable--which is why you're interested in object-oriented technology in the first place, right?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4631bf14a1e7c9cf371598d0ab1040c1b39017","amp;dn":"Design+Patterns%3A+Elements+of+Reusable+Object-Oriented+Software.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4631bf14a1e7c9cf371598d0ab1040c1b39017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,70,49,191,20,161,231,201,207,55,21,152,208,171,16,64,193,179,144,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
