Johnny can also be a little too trusting at times which haunts him later on. Lisa is a beautiful blonde fiance of Johnny. She has always gotten her way and will manipulate to get what she wants. She is a taker, with a double personality, and her deadly schemes lead to her own downfall. Mark is a young, successful and independent best friend of Johnny. He has a good heart, but gets caught up in Lisa's dangerous web and gives into temptation. This eventually brings him to great loss. Claudette is the classy, sophisticated mother of Lisa who has had disappointing relationships in her life. She wants her daughter to be married as soon as possible so she can benefit. Denny is an orphan boy, naive and confused about life, love, and friendship. Denny is very ambitious and also very grateful to the people that are in his life. &quot;The Room&quot; depicts the depths of friendship and relationships in one's life and raises life's real and most asked question: &quot;Can you ever really trust anyone?&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53997debe435c.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53997debe435c.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53997dec13554.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53997dec13554.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53997dec33d5d.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53997dec33d5d.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n",
