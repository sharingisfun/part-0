His normal day consists of social drinking with clients and being kicked around by his bosses. He finally gets a break though, as he's sent by his company to the tropical seas of Eastern China to deliver a disc. But his boat gets hijacked by a band of mercenaries hired to retrieve the disc. Rock (as he is newly dubbed by his captors) catches the interest of the only female merc Revy as she thinks he's worth a ransom, taking him hostage. However, the disc that was stolen has a terrible secret that's unknown to Rock, which causes massive confusion and chaos for both him and his kidnappers.\n                                      [color=Red]Season 02[/color]\nOkajima Rokuro - now known almost exclusively as 'Rock' - was once a typical, put-upon Japanese businessman. Then, on a routine business trip, he was kidnapped and ransomed by the Lagoon Company: a band of mercenary pirates operating out of the crime-riddled city of Roanapur. Abandoned by his bosses, he joined the Lagoon Company. Now he must try and stay afloat amongst the ever-shifting politics of the criminal underworld, while simultaneously avoiding death at the hands of his quick-tempered, gun-toting co-worker, 'Two Hand' Revy. \n\nContainer...........................Matroska\nFile size ...........................: 225MB\nOverall bit rate ..................:-1300-1500KBps\nWidth ................................: 1280\nHeight ...............................: 720\nDisplay aspect ratio .............: 16:9\nAudio Track 01....................English\nAudio Track 02......................Japanese \nFrame rate ..........................: 23.976 fps\nEpisodes............................. 24\nSubtitles............................ASS English\n\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/P4jvpbTsAQ.png[/img]\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/Cvi6Lzw1TI.png[/img]\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/OTg3nIZelA.png[/img]\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/j5GZuEio1a.png[/img]\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/X3SoT1YLvf.png[/img][/center]",
