  "description": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux (c) The Astronauts\n\n09/2015 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Adventure\n\nNote:\n~~~~~\nThis is the Remastered Edition using the Unreal Engine 4!\n\nThe Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game\nthat focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat\nor explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won't\nbe able to see them.\n\nYou play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives\na disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger,\nPaul arrives at EthanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to\nbe even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal\nmurder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth\nlooking into.\n\nInspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the\nearly twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly\nevolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private\ndetective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter\nis not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood,\nand the essential humanity of our characters.\n\nStill, the discoveries won't happen on their own, or without your help.\nUsing both Paul's supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the\ndead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery\nbehind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red\nCreek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.\n\n1. Burn or mount the image.\n2. Install the game.\n3. Copy over the cracked content from the /Crack directory on the image to\nyour game install directory.\n4. Play the game.\n5. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!",
