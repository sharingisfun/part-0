Will you succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Or return home triumphant with a hold full of precious loot? Events can turn out differently every game - sometimes, even if you make the same choices. Will you lose your sweetheart to a curse? Redeem, betray or consume the Genial Magician? Sell your soul to the Wistful Deviless or spurn her advances? Is the Dawn Machine your salvation, or your doom?\nYou are the captain. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your call.\n\n\n== Features:\n- A deep, compelling world packed with 200,000+ words of stories and secrets.\n- Light and dark. Stray too far from the gas-lamps of civilisation and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. But there is treasure out there in the darknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n- Beautiful, hand drawn art - castles of sparkling ice, prisons perched on lily pads, fog-shrouded lighthouses and the DAWN MACHINE. \n- Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, flensing cannons, and pneumatic torpedo guns. Or just buy a bigger, better ship.\n- Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them.\n- Choose from a menagerie of shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascots: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more!\n- Trade silk and souls, mushroom wine, and hallucinogenic honey.\n\n\n== Version: \nv1.0.3.2046 or GOG setup v2.4.0.5 from April 2, 2015\n\n\n== Version changes:\n\nERIK Patch Notes:\n\nERIK is here, introducing new items which you can use to instigate combat with some of the UnterzeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadliest beasts!\n\nTake one of these items to zee with you and use it to summon your quarry. Best used when you are a good distance from land, in open waters.\n\nThis means people who are struggling to find some of the rarer enemies in the game will be able to engage them, in a location of their choice.\n\nThis patch also contains a variety of fixes to some niggling issues we have had people report.\n\nNew features\n\nSummon zee-beast items Ã¢â‚¬â€œ use one of these out at zee to summon a powerful foe. Different items will summon different enemies.\nWeapons that require ammunition to use will now give you a clear indication of which item they will use up.\nIt should now be possible to reveal your entire chart, provided you have explored all of the navigable ocean around the coast.\nBug fixes\n\nEliminated some odd spaces that were appearing before or after some of the bold or italicized text.\nPrevented players from becoming locked in a story when revealing their past to one of their officers.\nYou should no longer be able to miss-click on the save/load screen and load in file from outside the scroll panel.\nResolved an issue were clicking the audio settings button would cause the music volume to be set to a new level.\nThe main menu button the gazetteer (the green cog) should no longer open a story if there is a story button behind it.\nScrolling the hold page should no longer result in items overlapping with the jettison cargo button.\nHappy hunting!\n\n\n== Instructions:\nIt's a GOG version, just launch setup\nClick options to chose location and accept EULA, install \nPlay - Enjoy - Seed - give me what I need\nSpeed!
