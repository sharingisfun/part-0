It will play any sample file (wav), generator (softsynth), VSTi &amp; DXi) or midi instrument you feed it.\nIntroducing FL Studio 9\n\nFL Studio 9 is a complete software music production environment, representing the culmination of more than 10 years of sustained &amp; focused development. FL9 is the fastest way from your brain to your speakers.\n\nWhat is FL9?\n\nFL Studio is a full-featured, open architecture, music production environment capable of audio recording, composing, sequencing and mixing, for the creation of professional quality music. The FL Studio philosophy is creative freedom:\n\n\nFree your audio - Route any instrument to any mixer track. Each mixer track can receive audio from any number of instruments, any number of other mixer tracks and a soundcard input. Mixer tracks, in turn, can send audio to any number of other mixer tracks and a soundcard output. Create sub-mixes, effects chains or complex mixes. FL studioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexible architecture sets audio free.\n\n\nFree your mind - Choose your preferred workflow, compose using the step-sequencer or piano roll. Create in pattern or track mode, then arrange your ideas in the free Ã¢â‚¬ËœpaletteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Playlist. The Playlist presents timeline as a virtual  Ã¢â‚¬ËœcanvasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ where each Playlist track can simultaneously hold any number of score, audio and automation events. Now thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freedom.\n\nInstruments\n\n\nMake virtually any sound - FL9 includes over 30 software synthesizers covering acoustic/synthetic bass, electric guitar, multi-sampler tools including piano &amp; strings, general sample playback and beat-slicing (With Rex 1 &amp; 2 support).\n\n\nSynthesis techniques - span subtractive, modelling, FM, RM, granular and additive. With the addition of FL SynthMaker you can further create &amp; share your own FL instruments, effects &amp; MIDI control dashboards without the need to write basic code.\n    \n\nOpen plugin standards - FL Studio supports all PC industry plugin instrument standards including VSTi (1/2), DXi(1/2), Buzz and Rewire. This means you can sequence with your favorite plugins and applications. \n\nAudio Recording &amp; Editing\n\n\nMulti-channel audio inputs - With the ability to simultaneously capture all the inputs on your audio-interface, FL Studio has the flexibility to record a single vocalist, guitar or a full symphony orchestra.\n\n\nArranging audio - Audio can be arranged, with complete freedom in the Playlist. Features include the ability to host an unlimited number of audio recordings, time-stretching, pitch-shifting, beat-slicing, cropping, editing and the re-arranging of audio with only a few mouse clicks. \n\n\nEdison - FL9Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s audio capabilities are further enhanced with Edison, the recording wave editor. Edison is an integrated audio editing and recording tool with spectral analysis, convolution reverb, noise reduction, loop-recording, loop-construction tools and more.\n\nFL Studio supports WAV, MP3, OGG, WavPack, AIFF, and REX audio formats.\n\nSequencing\n\nCompose and record your musical performances and ideas in the most logical way.\n\n\nPattern or track sequencing - You choose, record your musical performances and ideas in the most logical way. FL Studio 9 can simultaneously function as a pattern and track based sequencer. Reuse patterns as Pattern Clips in the Playlist or record song-length sequences, as desired.\n \n\nStep sequencer or Piano roll - Scoring tools include FL StudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary Step-sequencer, one of the most advanced Piano rollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in any software studio, event and multipoint automation envelopes. FL Studio supports MIDI input, standard controller compatibility, and the ability to simultaneously control multiple instrument channels from separate controllers.\n\nArranging\n\nFL Studio allows you to do what you want where and when you want.\n\n\nDetermine your own project design - In FL Studio 9, you decide how your project will be laid out. Unlike the competition, FL9's Playlist is a totally flexible and virtually unbounded workspace where Note Pattern, Audio and Automation data can be arranged and edited to suit your creative ideas and preferred workflow.\n\nMixing &amp; Mastering\n\nFL Studio provides all the tools you need to produce your tracks to high professional standards.\n\n\nThe mixer - FL9 includes a superb 104 track stereo track mixer that is about precision, control and flexibility. The mixerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tracks each hold up to 8 effects (VST, DX or FL's proprietary format). To create sub-mixes or mixing chains of almost unlimited complexity, each mixer track can be routed to any other mixer track, one of 4 dedicated 'send' channels and or the Master track.  Sends provide the ability to sidechain inputs to multi-input effects plugins. Finally, each of the mixer tracks can be routed to any output on your audio interface, now thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexibility.\n\n\nEffects - What about effects? FL Studio includes more than 40 effects spanning maximization, limiting, compression, delay, distortion, equalization (graphic &amp; parametric), filtering, phasing, flanging, chorus, vocoding and reverb. These have you covered for the creative broad-brush effects, through to the minutia of the mastering process.\n    \n\nOpen plugin standards ? FL Studio supports all PC industry plugin effect standards including VST (1/2), DX(1/2), Buzz and Rewire. This means you can mix with your favorite plugins and applications. \n\nLifetime free updates\n\nThere may be no such thing as a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfree lunchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ but there certainly is Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlifetime free updatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with Image LineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s update policy.\n\n\nNever pay for bug-fixes again! - Customers who purchase a download edition of FL Studio through our online shop receive lifetime free downloadable updates.
