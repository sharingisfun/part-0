Have you second-guessed a decision to walk in a poorly lit area late at night? When you see crime reports on the news, do you ever wonder if it could happen to you? Every day, unsuspecting people fall victim to muggers, pickpockets, carjackers, and other criminals. What can you do to make sure youÃ¢Â€â„¢re not one of them?\r\n\r\nIn Watch Your Back, Roger Eckstine presents dozens of possible risky scenarios that can occur in daily life and ways to counteract each threat. Potential hazards include:\r\nPaying for gas at the pump\r\nUsing the ATM\r\nRoad rage and the belligerent fender bender\r\nAn active shooter attack\r\nConcealed carry and the rigors of daily life\r\nAnd much more!",
