  "description": "Note:\nComplete Album. High Quality.\n\nEnglish Description:\n\nOn his debut album Thank You Allah, accomplished Swedish producer and singer Maher Zain effortlessly mixes the sounds of R&amp;B with traditional nasheed, soul with contemporary pop music, not just updating Islamic music, but fearlessly reviving it with contemporary music. Thank You Allah with its 13 tracks is an instant classic of great power and timeless, unassailably intense spirituality.\n\nFast becoming recognized as one of modern Islamic MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seminal voices after his ground-breaking single and animated music video ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPalestine Will Be Free,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Maher Zain is clearly poised to take up the torch with his Awakening Records debut, Thank You Allah. Maher ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the elegant artist and producer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ brings his music to a wider audience not by watering down his message, but by making a record of supreme power, conviction, and glorious beauty, incorporating elements of R&amp;B, traditional nasheed, pop, and Arabic &amp; Turkish music into daring arrangements. The lead song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;Thank You Allah&quot; is a gorgeous ballad of praise. While multi-lingual &quot;Ya Nabi Salam Alayka,&quot; is easily one of Islamic MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best ever singles. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlways Be ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a masterfully ebullient song of praise and dedication marrying funky beats with soulful vocals. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor the Rest of My LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a touching song from a husband to his wife, expressing in a beautiful and tasteful way his love and dedication to her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a subject seen as taboo by some in Islamic music. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAllahi Allah Kiya KaroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - a duet with Awakening Records stable mate Irfan Makki - gives this classic Qawwali song a modern makeover. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Chosen OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a sensitive and soulful tribute to Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. And ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaraka Allahu LakumaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an upbeat joyful wedding song. With its catchy hook and heartfelt lyrics, his track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInsha AllahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is poised to be one of the biggest hits in Islamic music ever. With ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHold My Hand,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the duet with Mesut Kurtis in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSubhana Allah,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen Your Eyes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAwaken,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ this album is packed from start to finish with hits.\n\nThank You Allah manages to masterfully strike that fine balance between powerful upbeat songs of praise or encouragement, and sensitive, inspired ballads. It is a bright and shining testament to faith in Allah and praise for his countless blessings. Throughout the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thirteen tracks, Maher uses his soft, sincere, and heart-piercing vocal ability, together with his masterful music production prowess to uplift his listeners and to elucidate the pure joy of spiritual and musical flight. He not only crosses but banishes lines of separation between nasheed and modern music. He touches on the doubts and weaknesses we endure in this battle called life, but at the end of it all, with the grace of Allah, we shall overcome this fight!\n\n\nOriginal Release Date: October 30, 2009\nLabel: Awakening Worldwide Ltd.\nCopyright: 2009 Awakening Worldwide Ltd.\nTotal Length: 1:09:33\nLanguage: English | Arabic\nGenre: RnB | Soul | Islamic Music\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 192kbps ",
