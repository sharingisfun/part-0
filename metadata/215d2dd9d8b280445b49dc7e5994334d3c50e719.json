Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments?including piano and harmonica?his style of hammer-on acoustic guitar and often idiosyncratic soloing on electric guitar are the lynchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished, yet consistently evocative sound.\n\nAlthough Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including swing, jazz, rockabilly, blues, and electronica throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles: folk-esque acoustic rock (as heard in songs such as &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; (sample (helpÃ‚Â·info)), &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; and &quot;Old Man&quot;) and electric-charged hard rock (in songs like &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;, &quot;Rockin&amp;#039; in the Free World&quot; and &quot;Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)&quot;). In more recent years, Young has started to adopt elements from newer styles of music, such as industrial, alternative country and grunge, the latter of which was profoundly influenced by his own style of playing, often bringing him the title of &quot;the godfather of grunge&quot;.\n\nGreatest Hits is Neil Young&amp;#039;s third compilation album after Decade and Lucky Thirteen. Eleven of the first twelve tracks appear on Decade, and the disc spans his solo career from 1969 through 1992.\n\nAll tracks on this album were remastered using the HDCD process, which Young has been utilizing for his studio work since 1995. The album was also released as a high-resolution DVD Audio disc, and in a two-disc format including the audio album plus a bonus DVD with videos for &quot;Rockin&amp;#039; in the Free World&quot; and the &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;. \n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Neil Young\n\n&quot;Down by the River&quot; ? 9:16 (17 January 1969) Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse \n&quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; ? 10:05 (18 January 1969) Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse \n&quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; ? 2:59 (20 March 1969) Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse \n&quot;Helpless&quot; ? 3:37 (7 November 1969) Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young \n&quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; ? 3:46 (12 March 1970) Neil Young \n&quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; ? 3:08 (15 March 1970) Neil Young \n&quot;Southern Man&quot; ? 5:31 (19 March 1970) Neil Young \n&quot;Ohio&quot; ? 2:59 (21 May 1970) Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young \n&quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; ? 2:10 (30 January 1971) Neil Young \n&quot;Old Man&quot; ? 3:22 (6 February 1971) Neil Young &amp; The Stray Gators \n&quot;Heart of Gold&quot; ? 3:07 (8 February 1971) Neil Young &amp; The Stray Gators \n&quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; ? 8:20 (29 November 1975) Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse \n&quot;Comes a Time&quot; ? 3:04 (2 November 1977) Neil Young \n&quot;Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)&quot; ? 4:59 (22 October 1978) Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse \n&quot;Rockin&amp;#039; in the Free World&quot; ? 4:41 (10 March 1989) Neil Young \n&quot;Harvest Moon&quot; ? 5:03 (22 September 1991) Neil Young \n\nReleased November 16, 2004 \nRecorded 1969 - 1991 \nGenre Rock, Country rock, Folk-rock \nLabel Reprise \nProducer(s) David Briggs, Neil Young, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Kendall Pacios, Elliot Mazer, Henry Lewy, Tim Mulligan, Ben Keith, Niko Bolas \n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215d2dd9d8b280445b49dc7e5994334d3c50e719","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+%28Greatest+Hits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215d2dd9d8b280445b49dc7e5994334d3c50e719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,93,45,217,216,178,128,68,91,73,220,126,89,148,51,77,60,80,231,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
