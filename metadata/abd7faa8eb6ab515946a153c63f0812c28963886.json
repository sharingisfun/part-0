Each member of the family group is known by his middle name (second given name) as opposed to his first given name.\nThe band's early music was an upbeat blend of southern rock and blues influences but the band has gradually expanded their sound to include a variety of genres and a more alternative rock or arena rock sound. Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaking in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album Because of the Times also reached the #1 spot. After the release of Only by the Night in September 2008 they finally achieved chart success in their native United States. The singles &quot;Sex on Fire&quot;, &quot;Use Somebody&quot; and &quot;Notion&quot; all peaked at #1 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks. The album itself was their first ever platinum-selling album in the United States. It was the best selling album of 2008 in Australia, being certified nine-times Platinum. Their fifth album, Come Around Sundown, will be released October 18 in the UK and October 19 in North America.  \n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Kings Of Leon - Youth &amp; Young Manhood\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
