  "description": "ANSYS, Inc. announced the availability of its leading engineering simulation solution, ANSYS 16.0, offers advanced functionality enabling engineers to rapidly innovate new products.\n\nANSYS 16.0 delivers major advancements across the company's entire portfolio, including structures, fluids, electronics and systems engineering solutions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ providing engineers with the ability to validate complete virtual prototypes.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the release include:\n\n- Enabling Connected Electronic Devices. The pervasive connectivity of electronic devices, evidenced by the Internet of Things, requires a higher standard for hardware and software reliability. ANSYS 16.0 delivers capabilities to verify electronics reliability and performance throughout the design process and complex electronics industry supply chains.\n\nAs part of the release, ANSYS is introducing the ANSYS Electronics Desktop. This single-window, highly integrated interface brings electromagnetic, circuit and systems analysis into a seamless working environment to maximize productivity and to ensure users are following simulation best practices.\n\nAnother important new feature in ANSYS 16.0 is the ability to create 3-D components and integrate them into larger electronic assemblies. This modeling approach can facilitate the creation of wireless communication systems, which is especially useful as these systems become more and more complex. Simulation-ready 3-D components are created and stored in library files that can be added to larger system designs without the need to apply excitations, boundary conditions and material properties. \n\n- Simulating the Total Spectrum of Structural Materials. Reducing weight while improving structural performance and design aesthetics is a challenge many engineers face. Thin materials such as sheet metal and new substances such as composites are often part of the solution, but these choices present simulation challenges.\n\nSheet metal and plate steel are common traditional material forms used to minimize weight while delivering required structural performance. ANSYS 16.0 accelerates the process for engineers to model these thin materials and define how parts are connected in a complete assembly.\n\nANSYS 16.0 provides new functionality for composite designs and comprehensive tools for understanding the solution results. Composites are another material alternative to drastically reduce weight, but they are difficult to model because of their non-homogeneous properties and their dependence on the manufacturing process to deliver maximum performance.\n\nANSYS 16.0 also provides advanced solutions for elastomers like rubber, which are often used in seals and vibration dampers. Seals can become severely distorted and come into contact with other parts, which adds to the complexity of the simulation. ANSYS 16.0 features adaptive remeshing, which refines the mesh in highly distorted areas without the need for the user to stop the simulation manually.\n\nContact simulation between multiple parts has also realized many advancements in ANSYS 16.0. These are some of the most challenging simulations for structural analysis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially with the expansion beyond traditional engineering material.\n\n\n\nIn addition to new capabilities and enhancements, ANSYS 16.0 delivers improved solver performance to provide users with a faster time to solution. \n\n- Simplifying Complex Fluid Dynamics Engineering Challenges. While manufacturers are constantly innovating their products to capture more market share, it comes with a challenge: engineers need to study more complex designs and physical phenomena Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with less time. ANSYS 16.0 reduces fluid dynamics simulation time for complex models by up to 40 percent.\n\nThis release further reduces the time for optimizing design changes by leveraging the adjoint optimization technology and making it more practical for engineers to use. A new adjoint designer tool enables engineers to perform multi-objective shape optimization, including constraints. They can now use the adjoint solver and model up to 50 million cells.\n\nEngineers designing turbomachinery equipment of all sorts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from pumps and fans to compressors and turbines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will benefit from significant simulation speed-up thanks to HPC scalability extending to thousands of CPU cores. Furthermore, continued advances in modeling transient blade row interaction will extend and improve engineers' ability to simulate the complex unsteady flow phenomena found in such rotating machinery as aircraft engines and power generation turbines.\n\n- Enabling Model-based Systems and Embedded Software Development. Virtually every industry has experienced growth in innovation based on systems including electronics, mechanical subsystems and embedded software. This trend has led to a number of challenges, which are changing how companies design and develop these complex systems. ANSYS 16.0 provides enhanced capabilities for both developers of systems and embedded software.\n\nANSYS 16.0 features extended modeling capabilities, enabling hardware and software engineers to define the intricacies of a system and its subsystems operations. This is crucial because as systems become more complex, engineers need greater definition of their operations. Systems and software engineers can better collaborate on joint projects, reducing development time and effort. ANSYS 16.0 addresses this need with the addition of behavioral diagram modeling.\n\nWithin the aeronautics domain, ANSYS 16.0 provides a model-based approach that satisfies the requirements of DO-330, the tools qualification document within DO-178C, for the highest levels of safety requirements. DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, is the new document that such authorities as the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Aviation Safety Agency and Transport Canada will use to approve all commercial software-based aerospace systems. ANSYS 16.0 is the first tool to meet that new certification requirement. \n\n- Introducing a Unified Multiphysics Environment. As part of the launch, ANSYS is introducing ANSYS AIMÃ¢â€žÂ¢, an innovative, immersive simulation environment that lowers the barrier to entry for multiphysics simulations. AIM simulation uses proven ANSYS technology packaged in a new intuitive environment, accessible to the entire engineering organization. AIM's guided simulation process paradigm delivers high levels of automation and provides opportunities for customization to automate engineering best practices.\n\nAbout ANSYS, Inc.\n\nANSYS brings clarity and insight to customers' most complex design challenges through fast, accurate and reliable engineering simulation.
