In the mirror he saw a 310lb man whose gut was bigger than a beach ball and a path laid out before him that wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t end well- with one foot already in the grave, the other wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t far behind. FAT, SICK &amp; NEARLY DEAD is an inspiring film that chronicles JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal mission to regain his health.
