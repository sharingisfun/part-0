You control and manage a car full of jerks as they explore cities, recruit weird people, argue with each other, and face gigantic swarms of slow zombies.\r\n\r\nDeath Road is built for replay value. Everything is randomized: locations, events, survivor appearances and personalities. There's a different story every time you play, set in a world that doesn't take itself too seriously","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94a4a2611a96b9b6e478ef58e01a5aa934c7f6d3","amp;dn":"Death+Road+to+Canada+v28.07.2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94a4a2611a96b9b6e478ef58e01a5aa934c7f6d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,164,162,97,26,150,185,182,228,120,239,88,224,26,90,169,52,199,246,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
