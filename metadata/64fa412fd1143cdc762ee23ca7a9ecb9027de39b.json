  "description": "BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S - 1961\n\n  Winner of two OscarsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, the romantic comedy that sparkles like diamonds! From the opening strains of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's haunting, OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-winning song &quot;Moon River,&quot; you'll once again be under the alluring spell of that madcap, carefree New York playgirl known as Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) in this 24-carat romantic comedy based of Truman Capote's best-selling novella. George Peppard is the struggling and &quot;sponsored&quot; young writer who finds himself swept into Holly's dizzying, delightfully unstructured lifestyle as she determinedly scours Manhattan for a suitable millionaire to marry. Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam and Mickey Rooney co-star; Mancini won an additional Academy AwardÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® for his enthralling musical score.\n\n  Starring: Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, Martin Balsam, Buddy Epsen, Mickey Rooney.\n\n  Directed by: Blake Edwards.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 50min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448",
