  "description": "The UndeletePlus application was designed to be a small utility that scans your hard drive for all files that can be undeleted and attempt to salvage the file for you. Sounds like magic? It isn't. You might not know it, but when you tell Windows to erase a file, Windows essentially does something like say &quot;okay, I am now going to consider this file null and void, and will allow other data writing operations to use the space that it occupies&quot;. In other words, no actual 'erasing' of the file occurs until Windows has a need to write over the hard drive space where that the file resides. UndeletePlus and programs like it do a thorough scan for files that are 'still there' on the hard drive and/or files that have enough data remaining that they can be salvaged.\neSupport UndeletePlus is a quick and effective way to restore accidentally deleted files. It can also recover files that have been emptied from the Recycle Bin, permanently deleted files within Windows using the Shift + Delete shortcut, and files that have been deleted from within a Command Prompt. One of eSupport UndeletePlus strengths is the ability to restore files that had been deleted from a flash memory drive. eSupport UndeletePlus can recover your precious vacation pictures from your cameras memory card and restore the business presentation that was lost from your USB thumb drive.\n\nOf course, the sooner you attempt to recover the file the better your chances. Also, smaller size files have a higher chance of being salvaged, and disks that have not been defragmented are better candidates for file recovery.\n\nUndeletePlus is a quick and effective way to retrieve deleted files, files removed from the Recycle Bin, in a DOS window, from Windows Explorer with the SHIFT key held down. UndeletePlus with its clean and simple interface, is a small, fast, useful, practical and powerful.\n\nThere's nothing quite like losing an important file you spent hours working on. But, just because you deleted it doesn't mean it's gone for good. You can use software to recover files that have been deleted. It isn't always foolproof. But many times you'll have some luck.\n\nThe program supports all Windows file systems for hard and floppy drives including FAT12/16/32, NTFS/NTFS5 and image recovery from CompactFlash, SmartMedia, MultiMedia and Secure Digital cards.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Undelete Plus&quot;:\n\nAfter scanning your hard drive, UndeletePlus creates file-type icons in the left margin of the screen that allow you to easily filter by file type\nUndeletePlus will create folder view for the deleted files.\nUndeletePlus will also allow filtering by size, date modified, and parts of the file name\nUndeletePlus is a small, fast, useful, practical, and powerful.",
