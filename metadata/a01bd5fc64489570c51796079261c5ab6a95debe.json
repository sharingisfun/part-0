The Magisters of the Divine Order want to &quot;cure&quot; you of your powers. But the Order has secrets of its own. Secrets that threaten everyone. If the world remains godless, chaos will rule. It's time for a new Divinity.\r\n\r\nChoose your race and origin story and see how differently the world reacts. Gather your party and blast your opponents with different elements in deep tactical turn-based combat. Explore the vast and layered world of Rivellon alone or with up to 4 players in drop-in/drop-out cooperative play.\r\n\r\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 is an entirely new experience built on the next-gen Divinity Engine, with a new UI, an all-new art-style, and advanced roleplay systems. Everything that made the original great returns: Go anywhere you want, kill anyone, find endless ways to solve problems and gather your ultimate RPG party","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01bd5fc64489570c51796079261c5ab6a95debe","amp;dn":"Divinity%3A+Original+Sin+2+%28Early+Access%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01bd5fc64489570c51796079261c5ab6a95debe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,27,213,252,100,72,149,112,197,23,150,7,146,97,197,171,106,149,222,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
