This way of life has persisted for hundreds of years, and yet, the people are still\npowerless against the earthquakes and cave-ins which occasionally devastate their villages.\nJeeha is one such village...\n\nOne day, while digging tunnels to expand Jeeha's edges, a boy named Simon happens to find a small,\nshiny drill. Meanwhile, Kamina Ã¢â‚¬â€ Simon's soon-to-be &quot;bro&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ insists that there is another land above\nthe village and tries to break through the ceiling in order to leave the cavern. He fails; however,\nan earthquake suddenly occurs, the ceiling collapses, and a gigantic robot Ã¢â‚¬â€ a &quot;Ganmen&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ crashes to the cave floor!\n\nKamina is now certain that there is a world above their tiny pit-village. Encouraged, he begins to\nfight recklessly against the robot, until he encounters another person who has arrived from the land\nabove. She is a beautiful girl by the name of Youko, who has come from a neighbouring village with a\nrifle in hand. She has been hunting the robot, but her shots only seem to irritate it. Desperately trying\nto escape its attacks, Simon brings Kamina and Yoko to what he had previously found: A mysterious robot\nwith a head for a body.\n\nAnd so begins the &quot;epic&quot; adventure...\n\n\nVIDEO\nVideo Source: BD-JPN\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720p HD (16:9)\nVideo FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\nCodec: AAC-LC\nTrack 1: English: Stereo\nTrack 2: Japanese: Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES\nTrack 1: English Signs/Songs\nTrack 2: English Subtitles\n\nEXTRAS\nEpisode 5.5 (Fansubbed by Nyoro~n_Subs)\nEpisode 6 Uncut Version (s1)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b997faca2bdd6bd346b0812d98106d6cc69d5cb7","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+Gurren+Lagann+1-27+Complete+%28Dual+Audio%29+%5BBDRip-720p-8bit%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b997faca2bdd6bd346b0812d98106d6cc69d5cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,151,250,202,43,221,107,211,70,176,129,45,152,16,109,108,198,157,92,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
