  "description": "    Criminal Minds revolves around an elite team of FBI profilers who analyse the country's most twisted criminal minds, anticipating their next move before they strike again.\n    David Rossi (Joe Mantegna) comes out of retirement to help the the Behavioral Analysis Unit lead by Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), a family man who's able to gain people's trust and unlock their secrets. Also on the team are Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), an expert in obsessional crimes; Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), a classical misunderstood genius whose social IQ is as low as his intellectual IQ is high; Jennifer 'JJ' Jareau (A.J. Cook), a confident young agent who acts as the unit liaison for the team; and the newest addition to the team Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who is an FBI Linguistics Expert and professor at Georgetown University. Also helping the team is Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness), the team's audio/visual technician.\n    Each member brings their own area of expertise to the table as they pinpoint predators' motivations and identify their emotional triggers in an attempt to stop them.
