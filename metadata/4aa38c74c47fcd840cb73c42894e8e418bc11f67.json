This book presents 20 simple fighting techniques that will win any fight, any time!\n\n Fight to Win teaches you how to fight with a minimum of technical jargon. It allows you to quickly develop the ability to win by learning a small number of techniques that ALWAYS work in EVERY situation. This is far more effective than learning hundreds of movements and variations which work only in specific circumstances (and are easily forgotten in the heat of the moment!).\n\nWith 400 full-color photos and easy-to-follow instructions, Martin Dougherty presents techniques such as:\n\nThe HammerfistÃ¢â‚¬â€delivered by straightening a bent arm and striking with the base of the fist\n\nThe Double Leg TakedownÃ¢â‚¬â€will make the opponent land so hard he'll be stunned and unable to defend himself\n\nThe Triangle ChokeÃ¢â‚¬â€uses the opponent's arm and shoulder to compress the carotid arteries and cut off blood supply to the brain and more!\n\n===========================================\n\nFight: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Ass-Kicking but Were Afraid You'd Get Your Ass Kicked for Asking\n\nPublisher: Harper \nEugene S Robinson\n2007\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0061189227\nISBN-13: 978-0061189227 \nEPUB \n224 pages \n21.3 MB\n\nCrushing your enemies, driving them before you, and hearing the lamentations of their women? It doesn't get any better than this.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œEugene Robinson, ripping off John Milius\n\n That's the sentiment that surges just below the surface of Eugene Robinson's Fight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an engrossing, intimate look into the allÃ¢â‚¬â€œabsorbing world of fighting. Robinson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a former bodyÃ¢â‚¬â€œbuilder, oneÃ¢â‚¬â€œtime bouncer, and lifelong fight connoisseur Ã¢â‚¬â€œ takes readers on a noÃ¢â‚¬â€œholdsÃ¢â‚¬â€œbarred plunge into what fighting is all about, and what fighters live for. If George Plimpton had muscles and had been choked out one too many timesÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œthis is the book he could have written.\n\n When Robinson and his fellow fighters mix it up, they live completely for the moment: absorbed in the feel of muscles slippery with sweat; the metallic tang of blood mingling with saliva in the mouth; the sweet, firm thud of taped knuckles impacting flesh. They fight because it feels good. They fight because they want to win. And even if they get their asses kicked, they fight because they love fighting.\n\n Fight is part encyclopedia, part panegyric to fighting in all its forms and glory. Robinson's narrative Ã¢â‚¬â€œ told in his trademark toughÃ¢â‚¬â€œguy, streamÃ¢â‚¬â€œofÃ¢â‚¬â€œconsciousness noir voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ punctuates this explanatory compendium of the fighting world. From wrestling, jiuÃ¢â‚¬â€œjitsu, boxing and muay thai to bar fighting, handÃ¢â‚¬â€œtoÃ¢â‚¬â€œhand combat, prison fighting and hockey fights, from the greatest movie fight scenes to how to throw the perfect left hook, Fight is a sceneÃ¢â‚¬â€œbyÃ¢â‚¬â€œscene tour of the bloody but beautiful underworld that is the art of fighting.\n\n With his aficionado's enthusiasm and fastÃ¢â‚¬â€œpaced, addictive voice, Robinson's Fight combines compelling text with beautiful photographs to create an illustrated book as edgy and interesting as it is gorgeous\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aa38c74c47fcd840cb73c42894e8e418bc11f67","amp;dn":"Fight+to+Win%3A+20+Simple+Techniques+That+Win+Any+Fight+%2BEverythin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aa38c74c47fcd840cb73c42894e8e418bc11f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,163,140,116,196,127,205,132,12,183,60,66,137,78,142,65,139,193,31,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
