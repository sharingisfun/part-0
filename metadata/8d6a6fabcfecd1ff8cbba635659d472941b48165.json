  "description": "Stephen Richard &quot;Steve&quot; Hackett (born 12 February 1950) is an English musician, songwriter and singer. He gained prominence as lead guitarist of the British progressive rock group Genesis, which he joined in 1970 and left in 1977 to pursue a solo career. Hackett contributed to six Genesis studio albums, three live albums and seven singles.\n\nIn 1986, Hackett co-founded the supergroup GTR with another progressive guitarist, Steve Howe of Yes and Asia. The group released the self-titled album GTR, which peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 in the United States and spawned the Top 20 single &quot;When the Heart Rules the Mind&quot;. When Hackett left GTR in 1987, the group disbanded.\n\nAfter leaving GTR, Hackett resumed his solo career and has released albums and toured worldwide on a regular basis since. His body of work encompasses many styles, including progressive rock, world music, and classical. His playing has influenced guitarists such as Eddie Van Halen, Alex Lifeson, Brian May and Steve Rothery. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010.\n\nWOLFLIGHT TRACKLIST\n\n    Out Of The Body\n    Wolflight\n    Love Song To A Vampire\n    The WheelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Turning\n    Corycian Fire\n    Earthshine\n    Loving Sea\n    Black Thunder\n    Dust And Dreams Heart Song\n\nBandmembers Live touring\n\nSteve Hackett - Guitars\n\nNad Sylvan - Vocals\n\nRoger King - Keyboards\n\nGary O'Toole - Drums\n\nRob Townsend - sax, flute and blown sundries\n\nLee Pomeroy - bass and Chapman Stick\n\n\nTOUR DATES\n\nOct 06: Guildford GLive\n\nOct 07: London O2 ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bush Empire\n\nOct 09: Northampton Derngate\n\nOct 10: Cardiff St DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hall\n\nOct 11: Southampton O2 Guildhall\n\nOct 13: Basingstoke Anvil\n\nOct 14: York Barbican\n\nOct 16: Aberdeen Music Hall\n\nOct 17: Gateshead Sage\n\nOct 18: Glasgow Royal Concert Hall\n\nOct 20: Leeds Town Hall\n\nOct 21: Llandudno Venue Cymru\n\nOct 23: Liverpool Philharmonic\n\nOct 24: Leicester De Montford Hall\n\nOct 25: Salford Lowry\n\nOct 27: Ipswich Regent Theatre\n\nOct 28: Bristol Colston Hall\n\nOct 30: Birmingham Symphony Hall\n\nOct 31: Southend Cliffs Pavilion\n\n\n\nGo to the shows and support the artist and seed this torrent",
