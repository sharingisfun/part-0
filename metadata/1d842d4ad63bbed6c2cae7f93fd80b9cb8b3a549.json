  "description": "nERv\n\nFar Cry 4 *Proper* (c) Ubisoft\n\n11/2014: RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION: UbiDRM + Ubisoft\n1: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: FPS, Adventure\n\nProper notes:\n\nFar.Cry.4-SKIDROW contains the preloaded data (v1.2) from Uplay packed\ntogether with bug filled binaries (v1.0) from an unknown source. This means\nthat the known bugs, listed in the game SupportReadme files as fixed, are\nstill present. Also when using the CrackFix\n\nOn top of that, using Far.Cry.4.v1.03.Update-SKIDROW doesn't fix the release\neither. Despite what the nfo claims, the crack is still bad and is causing\nproblems, e.g. game crashes and missing saves, especially in Windows 8.x\n\nNotable example: the first door you open down the stairs at the beginning\n\nWe bring you the version released to retail on Steam today, fully updated\nwith the v1.3 release day patch (lol) and a working crack\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nHidden in the towering Himalayas lies Kyrat, a country steeped in tradition\nand violence. You are Ajay Ghale. Traveling to Kyrat to fulfill your\nmother's dying wish, you find yourself caught up in a civil war to overthrow\nthe oppressive regime of dictator Pagan Min. Explore and navigate this\nvast open world, where danger and unpredictability lurk around every corner\nHere, every decision counts, and every second is a story. Welcome to Kyrat\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nEXPLORE AN OPEN WORLD FILLED WITH POSSIBILITIES\nDiscover the most diverse Far Cry world ever created. With terrain\nspanning from lush forests to the snowcapped Himalayas, the entire world\nis alive - and deadly\nFrom leopards, rhinos, black eagles, and vicious honey badgers, Kyrat\nis home to abundant wildlife. As you embark on your hunt for resources\nknow that something may be hunting you\nScout enemy territory from above in the all-new gyrocopter and then plummet\nback to earth in your wing suit. Climb aboard the back of a six-ton\nelephant and unleash its raw power on your enemies\nChoose the right weapon for the job, no matter how insane or unpredictable\nthat job might be. With a diverse arsenal, you'll be prepared for anything\nNot every journey should be taken alone. Far Cry 4 allows for a second\nplayer to drop in and drop out at any point, re-imagining the cooperative\nexperience in the true spirit of Far Cry for the next generation. You'll\nnow be able to discover and explore the living open world of Kyrat\ntogether\n\n1. Unrar\n2. Burn or mount the image\n3. Install the game\n4.
