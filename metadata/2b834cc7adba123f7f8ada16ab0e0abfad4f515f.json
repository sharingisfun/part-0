Led through numerous incarnations by guitarist/vocalist Robert Smith (born April 21, 1959), the band became notorious for its slow, gloomy dirges and Smith's ghoulish appearance, a public image that often hid the diversity of the Cure's music. At the outset, the Cure played jagged, edgy pop songs before slowly evolving into a more textured outfit. As one of the bands that laid the seeds for goth rock, the group created towering layers of guitars and synthesizers, but by the time goth caught on in the mid-'80s, the Cure had moved away from the genre. By the end of the '80s, the band had crossed over into the mainstream not only in its native England, but also in the United States and in various parts of Europe. The Cure remained a popular concert draw and reliable record-seller rhroughout the '90s, and their influence could be heard clearly on scores of new bands during the new millenium, including many that had little to do with goth. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1 '1979-1987'\n\n01.1015 Saturday Night\n02.Boys Don't Cry\n03.Jumping Someone Else's Train\n04.Three Imaginary Boys\n05.Play For Today\n06.A Forest\n07.Let's Go To Bed\n08.The Walk\n09.The Love Cats\n10.The Caterpillar\n11.In Between Days\n12.Push\n13.Kyoto Song\n14.A Night Like This\n15.Close To Me\n16.Why Can't I Be You\n17.A Thousand Hours\n18.Catch\n19.How Beatiful You Are\n20.Hot Hot Hot\n21.Just Like Heaven\n\n\nDisc 2 '1989-2004'\n\n01.Pictures Of You\n02.Love Song\n03.Lullaby\n04.Fascination Street\n05.Never Enough\n06.High\n07.Doing The Unstuck\n08.Friday I'm In Love\n09.Letter To Elise\n10.Mint Car\n11.Wrong Number\n12.Maybe Someday\n13.Out Of This World\n14.Signal To Noise\n15.Cut Here\n16.The End Of The World\n17.Taking Off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
