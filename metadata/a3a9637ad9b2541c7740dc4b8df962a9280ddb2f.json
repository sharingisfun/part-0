Humanity lives amid the remnants of eight great civilizations that have risen and fallen on Earth. These are the people of the Ninth World. This new world is filled with remnants of all the former worlds: bits of nanotechnology, the dataweb threaded among still-orbiting satellites,  bio-engineered creatures, and myriad strange and wondrous devices. These remnants have become known as the numenera.\n\nPlayer characters explore this world of mystery and danger to find these leftover artifacts of the past, not to dwell upon the old ways, but to help forge their new destinies, utilizing the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“magicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the past to create a promising future.\n\nIncluded in this torrent:\nMap of the Ninth World.pdf\nNumenera Character Sheets.pdf\nNumenera Player's Guide.pdf\nTales of the Ninth World.pdf\nXP Deck.pdf\nArtifacts and Oddities.pdf\nCypher Collection.pdf\nCypher Deck.pdf\nGM Screen.pdf\nIn Strange Aeons:Lovecraftian Numenera.pdf\nNinth World Bestiary Preview.pdf\nNinth World Bestiary.pdf\nNumenera Corebook.pdf\nThe Amber Monolith.pdf\nThe Nightmare Switch.pdf\nAlso Includes the Numenera Terrain PDFs (20 PDFs and 2 Instructional PDFs)\n\nIf you enjoy these materials, please support Monte Cook Games and purchase them from your local gaming supply store!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3a9637ad9b2541c7740dc4b8df962a9280ddb2f","amp;dn":"Numenera+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3a9637ad9b2541c7740dc4b8df962a9280ddb2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,169,99,122,217,178,84,28,119,64,220,75,141,249,98,169,40,13,219,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
