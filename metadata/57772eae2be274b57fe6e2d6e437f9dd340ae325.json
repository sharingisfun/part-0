Dom's associates are Miles' \r\nformer students, who Dom requires as he himself has given up being the \r\ndream architect for reasons he won't disclose. Dom's primary associate, \r\nArthur, believes it has something to do with Dom's deceased wife, Mal, who \r\noften figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or Dom's want to \r\n&quot;go home&quot; i.e. get back to his own reality, which includes two young \r\nchildren. Dom's work is generally in corporate espionage. As the subjects \r\ndon't want the information to get into the wrong hands, the clients have \r\nzero tolerance for failure. Dom is also a wanted man as many of his past \r\nsubjects have learned what Dom has done to them. One of those subjects, Mr. \r\nSaito, offers Dom a job he can't refuse: to take the concept one step \r\nfurther into inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject's dreams \r\nwithout them knowing. Inception can fundamentally alter that person as a \r\nbeing. Saito's target is Robert Michael Fischer, the heir to an energy \r\nbusiness empire, which has the potential to rule the world if continued \r\non the current trajectory. Beyond the complex logistics of the dream \r\narchitecture of the case and some unknowns concerning Fischer himself, \r\nthe biggest obstacles in success for the team become worrying about one \r\naspect of inception which Cobb fails to disclose to the other team members \r\nprior to the job, and Cobb's newest associate Ariadne's belief that Cobb's \r\nown subconscious, especially as it relates to Mal, may be taking over what \r\nhappens in the dreams.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Leonardo DiCaprio.\r\n=&gt;-Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\r\n=&gt;-Ellen Page.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Christopher Nolan.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Mystery : Sci-Fi.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: Named.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2010.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English : French : Italian.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.08 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 015 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 28mn.\r\n=&gt;-Inception 2010.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inception/\r\n=&gt;-Inception 2010.............: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/inception/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 528.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 645 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 170 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio French.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 162 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio Italian.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 155 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English.\r\n=&gt;-French.\r\n=&gt;-Italian",
