This book is different. That is because genuine transformations require hard training with utter dedication and commitment. Under the guidance of Adam Gethin, I discovered how radically I could transform my physique in just 10 weeks with the right training and nutrition plan. This book contains the programme I followed, detailing every workout and when to do it. It also includes a comprehensive overview of how to eat better and smarter for a stronger, more muscular body and a guide to the best supplements available to support muscle building, fat burning and general health","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da0dcef9f4f78bb2b75cb74190d31c01e547d86","amp;dn":"Men%26rsquo%3Bs+Fitness+Workout+Manual+2015+%2B+10+Week+Body+Plan+-+Yo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da0dcef9f4f78bb2b75cb74190d31c01e547d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,160,220,239,159,79,120,187,43,117,203,116,25,13,49,192,30,84,125,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
