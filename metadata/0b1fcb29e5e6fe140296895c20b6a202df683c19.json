  "description": "\n'Sounds of Summer: The Vest Best of the Beach Boys' is a 2003 compilation of the Beach Boys greatest hits. \n\nThe most comprehensive Beach Boys product ever released, the collection contains 30 remastered tracks, clocking in at 76 minutes, and including nearly every US Top 40 hit of their career making it the longest single-disc American collection ever, with all but five tracks being pulled from the band's peak (1962-1969).\n\nNot presented in chronological order, 'Sounds of Summer' is rather divided into 'sets' of tunes providing a smooth, easy listen. \n\nWith the wealth of material included, a true cornucopia of collected hits.\n\n\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nSounds of Summer:\n\nThe Very Best of The Beach Boys\n\n2003\n\n\n \n  CD / 2003 / Remastered / VBR-V0\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
