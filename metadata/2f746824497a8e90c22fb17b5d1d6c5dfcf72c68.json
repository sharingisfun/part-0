While he spends his days drunk, his kids learn to take care of themselves.\n\nThe show's producers sought to distinguish it from previous American working-class shows by highlighting how Frank's alcoholism affects his family. Paul Abbott, creator of the original, said, &quot;It's not My Name Is Earl or Roseanne. It's got a much graver level of poverty attached to it. It's not blue collar; it's no collar.&quot; When John Wells, the showrunner, began pitching the show, he had to fight efforts to place the show in the South or in a trailer park. He explained, &quot;We have a comedic tradition of making fun of the people in those worlds. The reality is that these people aren't 'the other' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they're people who live four blocks down from you and two blocks over&quot;.\n\n\nMAIN CAST\n\n\nWilliam H. Macy as Frank Gallagher\n    Father to the six Gallagher children. He is a selfish alcoholic and a complete narcissist who has done nothing for years but collect disability checks (illegally) and drink heavily. He begins a relationship with Sheila Jackson when he discovers that she gets maximum disability benefits for her agoraphobia. He is the biological father of Fiona, Lip, Debbie, Carl, and LiamÃ¢â‚¬â€but not Ian. He often self-righteously pontificates about political and social issues, yet spends most of his time developing schemes to cheat the system and take advantage of others in order to make money. He pays little attention to his children, but can display care and concern for them in drastic circumstances.\n\nEmmy Rossum as Fiona Gallagher\n    The eldest of the Gallagher children. Because of her mother's absence and Frank's neglect, most of the responsibility of child-rearing falls on her shoulders; this forced her to drop out of high school in her junior year. She works a few dead-end minimum-wage jobs to support her five siblings. Though often stressed and exhausted by her responsibilities, she never fails to perform them. Prone to total-selflessness, she sometimes needs to be reminded to look out for her own happiness as well. \n\nJeremy Allen White as Phillip &quot;Lip&quot; Gallagher\n    The second Gallagher child and the most academic. He is a straight-A student who uses his intelligence in various money-making schemes, such as running an ice-cream truck that sells beer and marijuana, or taking the SATs for fellow students (often scoring a 2400, a perfect score). Despite his above-average intelligence, he is not considered responsible; he smokes cigarettes, uses marijuana, drinks alcohol, and has unprotected sex. He has a strong bond with his brother Ian and is the first family member to know that Ian is gay. Lip develops a torrid relationship with Karen after helping her in math, and soon falls in love with her. But after Karen marries Jody and gives birth to a baby belonging neither to Lip or Jody, Lip begins a relationship with Mandy Milkovich.\n\nCameron Monaghan as Ian Gallagher\n    The third Gallagher child and (according to Frank) the most like their mother. He participates in Army JROTC at school and works at the Kash and Grab grocery store. His middle name is Clayton. He is gay but only &quot;out&quot; to Fiona, Frank, Jimmy, Monica, Mickey, Mandy, and Lip. He has had several furtive relationships: first with his employer, the Muslim grocer Kash, and later with (also closeted) neighborhood thug, Mickey Milkovich. He is not Frank's biological son, but he is his biological nephew.\n\nEmma Kenney as Debbie Gallagher\n    One of the middle Gallagher children , Debbie is kind, helpful and has a good heart. She's willing to bring her baby brother to school for show-and-tell when there's no one else to watch him, puts a pillow under her father's head when he's passed out on the floor, and collects money for charity year-roundÃ¢â‚¬â€only some of which she keeps for herself. Debbie is very loving, and shows the most forgiveness for her father's neglect and irresponsibility as well as her mother's absence. She is very mature in some ways, and therefore has trouble making friends with people her age. \n\nEthan Cutkosky as Carl Gallagher\n    The second-youngest Gallagher child. He shares a room with older brothers Lip and Ian, who try to keep their more adult interests from him. Carl is often in trouble at school for attacking other students. In his early years, he displays several psychopathic tendencies such as mutilating his toys and killing stray animals. \n\nBrennan Kane Johnson &amp; Blake Alexander Johnson as Liam Gallagher\n    The youngest of the Gallagher children. He is black despite having two white parents due to a recessive black gene the Gallagher's acquired from Frank's grandmother, who (allegedly) had an affair with a jazz musician. \n\nSteve Howey as Kevin &quot;Kev&quot; Ball\n    The bartender at the Alibi Room (the one bar where Frank has not been banned) and the Gallaghers' neighbor and friend. Though frequently exasperated by Frank's lifestyle, he gives him drinks on credit and cashes his disability checks for him. He and Veronica have a successful relationship, though he is technically married to another woman who previously left him. He is dyslexic and grew up in foster care, living with several families. \n\nShanola Hampton as Veronica &quot;Vee&quot; Fisher\n    The Gallaghers' neighbor, Fiona's best friend and confidante, she often gives her advice concerning relationships, caring for her siblings, and caring for herself. Always willing and able to lend a hand, Veronica had pursued a medical career until she was fired from the hospital for stealing medical supplies. She currently works as a webcam girl. \n\n Joan Cusack as Sheila Jackson\n    An agoraphobic germophobe, Karen's mother and Eddie's widow. Sheila developed her conditions when Karen was young, and has tried to overcome them for years. Frank seduces her in order to live in her home, taking advantage of her cooking, disability checks, and bedroom hospitality. Sheila is a kind and caring person, if a bit empty-headed. \n\nJustin Chatwin as Steve Wilton/Jimmy Lishman     \n    A young man relentlessly pursuing Fiona, going to great lengths to win her over. He owns expensive things and throws money around liberally, which Fiona finds off-putting until she discovers that he steals cars for a living. It is later discovered that his real name is Jimmy and he comes from a wealthy family. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f746824497a8e90c22fb17b5d1d6c5dfcf72c68","amp;dn":"Shameless+%28US%29+Season+2+-+COMPLETE+720p+HDTV+x264+%5BMKV%2CAC3%2C5.1%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f746824497a8e90c22fb17b5d1d6c5dfcf72c68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,116,104,36,73,122,142,144,194,47,177,123,93,29,108,93,252,247,44,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
