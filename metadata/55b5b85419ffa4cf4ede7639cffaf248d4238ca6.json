  "description": "What is mocha video:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagineersystems.com/products/what-is-mocha/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagineersystems.com/products/what-is-mocha/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmocha Pro is a stand alone software utility optimized for visual effects and post-production challenges.\n-Planar Motion Tracking\n-Advanced Roto &amp; Mask Creation\n-Object Removal &amp; Clean Plate\n-Lens Distortion Calibration\n-3D Camera Solver\n-Screen Inserts &amp; Mesh Warper\n-Image Stabilization &amp; more\n*New: mocha Pro 4 with advanced tools for stereoscopic 3D, customizable keyboard shortcuts, Adobe Premiere support, python scripting, improved format support and more.\n\nFeatures\n\nPlanar Tracking \n\nWhen other trackers fail, users turn to mocha's rock solid tracking. mochaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2.5D planar motion tracking engine accurately follows translation, scale, rotation, skew and perspective. Unlimited tracking layers handle reflections, obstructed and blurred objects, even areas with low detail. The AdjustTrack module and overlay tools help solve tracking challenges with pixel-perfect accuracy.\n\nAdvanced Roto Tools \n\nCreate animated roto masks with less keyframes. X-spline and Bezier creation tools are purposely designed for artists to easily create detailed roto shapes. When linked to mochaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s planar tracking, roto shapes inherit motion and perspective, dramatically reducing manual keyframe work. Advanced tools for shape editing include per-point edge feathering, join layers tool, transform tool, group layers and more making mocha the ideal system for rotoscoping. \n\nObject Removal &amp; Clean Plating \n\nAutomatically remove unwanted elements, wires, rigs and tracking marks with ease. mocha ProÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Remove Module is an amazing alternative to traditional clone and paint techniques for getting rid of unwanted pixels and removing objects. It automatically detects and blends pixels from other frames with little user input, offering massive time savings. mocha ProÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clean plate functionality imports and corrects fixed frames for digital beauty work and matte painting. \n\n3D Camera Solver \n\nCamera tracking for 3D visual effects. Solve 3D match moving capabilities with planar ease. Unlike feature based tracking, mocha solves the 3D camera based on user-selected planes. This fast and easy-to-use solution is ideal for set extensions, 3D text and particle tracking. Additionally the 3D solver can be used to assist other 3D tracking applications on difficult shots with low detail or significant foreground occlusions. \n\nStereoscopic 3D \n\nNew tools optimized for stereo 3D projects. mocha Pro 4 has been updated to support native stereo 3D. This new workflow uses planar tracking analysis on Ã¢â‚¬Å“both eye viewsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to reduce manual offsets and tedious keyframe work on stereo 3D rotoscoping, tracking, 3D camera solve and object removal.\n\nLens Module \n\nCalibrate, correct and remove lens distortion. This simple and easy-to-use interface allows users to calibrate the distortion introduced by camera lenses. Unwanted lens distortion can be removed or matched for realistic compositing. Export to the free mocha Lens plug-in for After Effects or export distortion map data for Nuke, Flame, Fusion and more*. \n\nStabilize Module \n\nSmooth camera jitter and lock down shots. The stabilize module can lock down camera motion or stabilize moving objects for visual effects and finishing work. A smooth option with selectable anchor frames helps reduce high frequency jitters while maintaining original camera motion. Center, scale or crop stabilized footage based on user driven planar tracking. \n\nInsert Module \n\nRender match moves and screen inserts with motion blur or mesh warp distortion. The Insert Module allows you to render an image onto a tracked surface within mocha Pro. Powerful mesh warp distortion tool allows the user to wrap and bend inserts onto non flat surfaces. Combines with Lens Module for realistic VFX compositing on distorted footage. \n\nWhat is new in version 4.0.0 \n\n-Keyboard Shortcut Customization \n-Stereo 3D Tracking \n-Stereo 3D Rotoscoping \n-Stereo 3D Remove \n-Export to NukeTracker Node \n-Export to Adobe Premiere Pro CC Masks \n-Python API \n\nSystem Requirements\n\n-Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows XP Professional SP2 or higher, Windows Vista Business or Ultimate, on x64. \n-Recommended Hardware Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or equivalentMemory: 4 GB +\n-Disk: High-speed disk array\n-Graphics Card: NVDIA Quadro FX 1500 or equivalent\n-Monitor: 1920Ãƒâ€”1080 or higher\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagineersystems.com/products/mocha-pro/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagineersystems.com/products/mocha-pro/&lt;/a&gt;",
