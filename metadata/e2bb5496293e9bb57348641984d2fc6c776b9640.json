You'll get both the insights and the techniques you need to apply this knowledge. The world will become your lab, and every person you meet, a chance to experiment.\n\nThe Charisma Myth is a mix of fun stories, sound science, and practical tools. Cabane takes a hard scientific approach to a heretofore mystical topic, covering what charisma actually is, how it is learned, what its side effects are, and how to handle them.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nReviews:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFox Cabane's distinct writing style...makes reading each chapter both informational and fun.
