  "description": "uTorrent Pro 3.4.8 Build 42449 Stable Incl Crack + Portable Multilingual\r\n\r\nSharing files over the Internet using torrents is quite popular and there are a few dedicated applications that can facilitate the file transfer. Such a BitTorrent client is uTorrent, a well-known program that ranks high among its peers.\r\n\r\nAd-supported installation and straightforward GUI\r\nThis tool comes with loads of useful features and is very easy to use. Even if the installation does not last very long, you should pay close attention to the third-party software included as it may change the settings of your web browser.\r\n\r\nuTorrent will greet you with a very nice and simple interface, designed to provide you quick access to its main functions. Thus, youÃ¢Â€â„¢ll be able to start new downloads, pause, stop or delete the existing ones, or manage the files youÃ¢Â€â„¢ve already downloaded straight from the main window.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to RSS feeds, adjust speed limits, and look for items from the main window\r\nThe application enables you to quickly find new content to download using a powerful built-in search function.

We found that out during our tests where it performed flawlessly and the stress on system resources was minimal.\r\n\r\nAnd if that doesnÃ¢Â€â„¢t convince you to give uTorrent a chance, you should note that it is also able to download the selected content only when youÃ¢Â€â„¢re away from the computer. It does that thanks to a special function for pausing the torrents when user activity is detected.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nAll things considered, it is safe to say that uTorrent remains a heavyweight player in its category, having millions of users worldwide to emphasize that. With a complete feature pack, great ease of use and seamless integration with any system, this software is definitely a keeper for anyone who uses torrents to share files.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nâ€¢ Multiple simultaneous downloads\r\nâ€¢ Configurable bandwidth scheduler\r\nâ€¢ Global and per-torrent speed limiting\r\nâ€¢ Quick-resumes interrupted transfers\r\nâ€¢ RSS Downloader\r\nâ€¢ Password-protected boss key\r\nâ€¢ Global run-command feature on torrent completion/state change\r\nâ€¢ UDP proxying for SOCKS5\r\nâ€¢ Proxy privacy features\r\nâ€¢ Improved set download location/relocate feature (now moves files for you)\r\nâ€¢ Show add torrent dialog for magnet links\r\nâ€¢ Add option to pause torrents when user activity is detected on the computer\r\n\r\nWhats New \nhttp://blog.utorrent.com/releases/windows/",
