Create ideas, make changes without stopping, and capture everything as you work. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used music software before, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already familiar with one half of Ableton Live. LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arrangement View is a familiar working space: time moves from left to right, while tracks are stacked vertically. But Live also features the revolutionary Session View: a unique sketchpad for improvising, playing and performing with musical ideas, without the constraints of the timeline. Freely and independently start and stop any number of audio or MIDI loops - everything stays in sync. Almost everything in Live works in real-time - add, reorder or remove devices, play with LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexible track routing and more - all without interrupting your creative flow. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n9.1.7 Release Notes \n\nImprovements and feature changes:\n\nAdded control surface support for M-Audio Oxygen 4th generation controllers.\n\nBugfixes:\n\nWhen choosing Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Individual TracksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the Export Audio/Video dialog, tracks using the External Instrument device would not be exported correctly.\nFixed a bug which caused modulations for arrangement clips to disappear when undoing and redoing after duplicating a track.\nImproved fonts for Retina displays (Mac OS X only).\nImproved graphics for the Track Status Display and the Plug-in browser icon on Retina displays (Mac OS X only).\nFixed a graphics problem which could occur on OS X 10.10 Yosemite when a Max for Live device was instantiated directly at application launch, e.g. by double-clicking an .als file or by having a template set containing a Max for Live device.\nFixed a graphics problem which could occur on OS X 10.10 Yosemite when opening the &quot;Export Audio/Video&quot; dialogue and having the &quot;Zoom Display&quot; preference set to a value higher than 100%.\nThe Simpler instrument could lose certain macro mappings after converting a Sampler to Simpler and then enabling Simpler's Pitch Envelope.\nFixed the spacing of the &quot;Hz&quot; icon on Simpler's LFO Rate switch on Retina displays\nUnder certain conditions, the Tension instrument could produce unwanted noise bursts after loading a preset and then playing the first note.\nLive could crash when undoing and redoing after importing a clip or a track containing automation from the browser.
