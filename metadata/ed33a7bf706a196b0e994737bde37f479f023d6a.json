She aches to travel back through time again to find the love of her life, but, in order to do that, she must leave their daughter behind. It has been 20 years since she and Jamie were forced to separate. Can she risk everything, maybe even her life, on a gamble that their love has withstood the long, rigorous test of time?

The four volumes of her New York Times bestselling saga, featuring eighteenth century Scotsman James Fraser and his twentieth century, time-traveling wife, Claire Randall, have nearly five million U.S. copies in print.\n\nThe story of OUTLANDER begins just after the Second World War, when a British field nurse named Claire Randall walked through a cleft stone in the Scottish highlands and was transported back some two hundred years to 1743.\n\nHere now is THE FIERY CROSS, the eagerly awaited fifth volume in this remarkable, award-winning series of historical novels. The year is 1771, and war is coming. Jamie Fraser's wife tells him so. Little as he wishes to, he must believe it, for hers is a gift of dreadful prophecy-a time-traveler's certain knowledge. To break his oath to the Crown will brand him a traitor; to keep it is certain doom. Jamie Fraser stands in the shadow of the fiery cross-a standard that leads nowhere but the bloody brink of war.\n\nCrossing the boundaries of genre with its unrivaled storytelling, Diana Gabaldon's new novel is a gift both to her many loyal fans and to the lucky listeners who have yet to discover her.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Random House Audio; Abridged edition (November 6, 2001)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0553714473\nISBN-13: 978-0553714470\n\n---------------\n\nA Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander) #6 By Diana Gabaldon\n___\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511A85F6JQL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511A85F6JQL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nEagerly anticipated by her legions of fans, this sixth novel in Diana GabaldonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling Outlander saga is a masterpiece of historical fiction from one of the most popular authors of our time.\n\nSince the initial publication of Outlander fifteen years ago, Diana GabaldonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New York Times bestselling saga has won the hearts of readers the world over Ã¢â‚¬â€ and sold more than twelve million books. Now, A Breath of Snow and Ashes continues the extraordinary story of 18th-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his 20th-century wife, Claire.\n\nThe year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest.\n\nWith chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence Ã¢â‚¬â€ with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports JamieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.\n\nSeries: Outlander\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Recorded Books; Unabridged edition (September 27, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1419361538\nISBN-13: 978-1419361531\n\n------------------------\n\nAn Echo in the Bone #7 By Diana Gabaldon \n___\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XlrCH2b+L.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XlrCH2b+L.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nTwo hundred years separated Highlander Jamie Fraser from wartime nurse Claire Randall. They still found a way to be together. Now the year is 1777 and finally the future is threatening to catch up with them...With the American rebellion growing in intensity all around them, Jamie and Claire know that being on the winning side is no guarantee of safety. Making their way back to Lallybroch to fulfil a family promise might seem one way of thwarting fate, but in the chaos of war every avenue of escape is bristling with danger, and even the time-travelling Claire cannot foresee the tragedy that could tear her and Jamie apart for ever. Meanwhile, in the apparent safety of the 20th century, their daughter reads Jamie and Claire's letters, breathlessly watching the unfolding of her parents' story - even as the past threatens her own family in the present...\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Recorded Books, LLC; Unabridged edition (October 20, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1440745528\nISBN-13: 978-1440745522\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
