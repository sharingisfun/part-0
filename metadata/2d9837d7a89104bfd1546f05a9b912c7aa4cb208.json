RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: EA/Crap\n             2 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: RPG\n \n Not everyone will survive. An ancient alien race, known only as &quot;Reapers&quot;,\n has launched an all-out invasion leaving nothing but a trail of destruction\n in their wake.\n Earth has been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of total annihilation, and\n you are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is extinction.\n \n You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can forge in your own image.\n You determine how events will play out, which planets to explore, and whom\n to form alliances with as you rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat\n once and for all. How you wage this war is completely up to you: go into\n combat with guns blazing or use cover to plan a more tactical assault.\n Utilize your squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain death\n from a distance or go toe-to-toe with enemies using devastating melee\n attacks. Mass Effect 3 will react to each decision you make as you play\n through a truly unique experience of your own creation.  \n\n 2. Burn or mount the image.\n 3. Install the game.\n 4. Copy the cracked content located in the Crack directory on either disc\n    into BinariesWin32 of your installation directory, overwriting\n    existing files.\n 5. Play the game.\n 6. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!  \n\n As usual we recommend firewalling the executables, not using Origin, and\n avoiding EA.  \n\nUploader Note: Please don't mind inside .jpg file included by one of our preseeding\nsupporting uploader,sometimes my gameseedbox is dead and in this case i took a torrent\nfrom a private site with private seeders for better speeds-seeds via dht/peer exchange+my\nown bandwidth for about 100 GiB.\n\nNote: We need anything you can offer as early releases,seedboxes,links,accounts,etc\nplease contact us on piratepedia[@]msn/gmail.com or our website torentz 3xforum ro\nSeed Stats: 20-400 GiB at aprox 10 MiB/sec/20 slots per torrent\n\nMass Effect 3-RELOADED Torrent Free Download\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7&lt;/a&gt;",
