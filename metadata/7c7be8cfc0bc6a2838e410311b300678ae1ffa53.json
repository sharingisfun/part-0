  "description": "\n\n\nMetallica\nGarage Inc. (1998)\n\n\n\nMetallica spent most of 2000 embroiled in controversy by spearheading a legal assault against Napster, a file-sharing service that allowed users to download music files from each other's computers. Aggressively targeting copyright infringement of their own material, the band notoriously had over 300,000 users kicked off the service, creating a widespread debate over the availability of digital music that raged for most of the year. In January 2001, bassist Jason Newsted announced his amicable departure from the band. Shortly after the band appeared at the ESPN awards in April of the same year, Hetfield, Hammett, and Ulrich entered the recording studio to begin work on their next album, with producer Bob Rock lined up to handle bass duties for the sessions (meanwhile, rumors swirled of former Ozzy Osbourne/Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez being considered for the vacated position). In July, Metallica surprisingly dropped their lawsuit against Napster, perhaps sensing that their controversial stance did more bad than good to their &quot;band of the people&quot; image. That same summer, the band's recording sessions (and all other band-related matters) were put on hold as Hetfield entered an undisclosed rehab facility for alcoholism and other addictions. He completed treatment and rejoined the band as they headed back into the studio in 2002 to record St. Anger, which was later released in mid-2003.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Free Speech For The Dumb\n02.It's Electric\n03.Sabra Cadabra\n04.Turn The Page\n05.Die, Die My Darling\n06.Loverman\n07.Mercyful Fate\n08.Astronomy\n09.Whiskey In The Jar\n10.Tuesday's Gone\n11.The More I See\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Helpless\n02.The Small Hours\n03.The Wait\n04.Crash Course In Brain Surgery\n05.Last Caress/Green Hell\n06.Am I Evil\n07.Blitzkrieg\n08.Breadfan\n09.The Prince\n10.Stone Cold Crazy\n11.So What\n12.Killing Time\n13.Overkill\n14.Damage Case\n15.Stone Dead Forever\n16.Too Late Too Late\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
