It contains no combat\nor explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won't\nbe able to see them.\nYou play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives\na disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger,\nPaul arrives at Ethan s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to\nbe even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal\nmurder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth\nlooking into.\nInspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the\nearly twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly\nevolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private\ndetective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter\nis not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood,\nand the essential humanity of our characters.\nStill, the discoveries won't happen on their own, or without your help.\nUsing both Paul's supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the\ndead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery\nbehind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red\nCreek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.\n\n-Install\n-Copy crack\n-Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2604d73be8f680ca61fcce2ae4820ffbd741e647","amp;dn":"The+Vanishing+of+Ethan+Carter+Redux+v1.01u2-RG+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2604d73be8f680ca61fcce2ae4820ffbd741e647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,4,215,59,232,246,128,202,97,252,206,42,228,130,15,251,215,65,230,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
