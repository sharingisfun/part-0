By contrast, their albums could be spotty and strained by self-conscious artistry. Hotel California was arguably the band's best single album--it was certainly the Eagles' biggest original disc-- and it also underscored the band's need to make a big statement. The title tune reflected the album's theme\nof paradise lost in California, painting this picture with a musical arrangement that punctuated strumming guitars with dramatic drums, and perhaps the band's most famous lyric: \n\n&quot;You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.&quot; &quot;New Kid in Town&quot; was an equally fine albeit much more traditional Eagles ballad. &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; aspired to hard rock but largely gunned its engine without taking off. The rest is okay, but nothing more than secondary Eagles songs that happened to be nestled into the album that came to define the `70s supergroup. --John Milward\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Hotel california                                     [06:32]\n02.New kid in town                                      [05:05]\n03.Life in the fast lane                                [04:46]\n04.Wasted time                                          [04:56]\n05.Wasted time (reprise)                                [01:24]\n06.Victim of love                                       [04:10]\n07.Pretty maids all in A row                            [03:59]\n08.Try and love again                                   [05:12]\n09.The last resort                                      [07:28]\n____\n\n43:32 min\n 62,5 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:105f8b6185374d9fbbd2dbb4ad59898524ba2c97","amp;dn":"The_Eagles-Hotel_California-%28Retail%29-1976-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"105f8b6185374d9fbbd2dbb4ad59898524ba2c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,95,139,97,133,55,77,159,187,210,219,180,173,89,137,133,36,186,44,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
