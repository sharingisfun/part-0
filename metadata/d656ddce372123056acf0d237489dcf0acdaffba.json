  "description": "The Magic Words: Writing Great Books for Children and Young Adults by Cheryl Klein\r\n2016 | ISBN: 039329224X | English | 384 pages | AZW3, MOBI, EPUB | 2 MB\r\n\r\nThis master class in writing childrenÃ¢Â€â„¢s and young adult novels will teach you everything you need to know to write and publish a great book.\r\n\r\nThe best childrenÃ¢Â€â„¢s and young adult novels take readers on wonderful outward adventures and stirring inward journeys. In The Magic Words, editor Cheryl B. Klein guides writers on an enjoyable and practical-minded voyage of their own, from developing a saleable premise for a novel to finding a dream agent. She delves deep into the major elements of fictionâ€•intention, character, plot, and voiceâ€•while addressing important topics like diversity, world-building, and the differences between middle-grade and YA novels. In addition, the bookÃ¢Â€â„¢s exercises, questions, and straightforward rules of thumb help writers apply these insights to their own creative works. With its generous tone and useful tools for story analysis and revision, The Magic Words is an essential handbook for writers of childrenÃ¢Â€â„¢s and young adult fiction",
