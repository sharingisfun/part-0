Her repertoire ranges from a swinging Ã¢â‚¬Å“StompinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ at the SavoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and an emotional Ã¢â‚¬Å“It Might as Well Be SpringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to an English folk ballad (Ã¢â‚¬Å“TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), spirituals, an R&amp;B song (Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Been Gone Too LongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and the theme song from the movie Middle of the Night. Somehow Simone brings credibility to each of these very different songs. She does not play much piano (just cameos on two songs) and is backed by a subtle orchestra arranged by Bob Mersey that is effective accompanying her vocals. This session finds Nina SimoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice in top form and with a few exceptions is generally jazz-oriented.\n\n01. Blue Prelude 03:21\n02. Children Go Where I Send You 02:52\n03. Tomorrow (We Will Meet Once More) 03:02\n04. StompinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ At The Savoy 02:10\n05. It Might As Well Be Spring 03:57\n06. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Been Gone Too Long 02:11\n07. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Him Over There 02:32\n08. Chilly Winds DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Blow 02:47\n09. Theme From Ã¢â‚¬ËœMiddle Of The NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 02:30\n10. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get Out Of This Mood 02:33\n11. Willow Weep For Me 03:14\n12. Solitaire 03:25\n\n1959 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nina Simone At Town Hall\n\nOne of Nina SimoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest recordings, this Colpix LP features the unique singer/pianist performing classic versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Is the Color of My True LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hair,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Other Woman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wild Is the Wind.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With supportive work from bassist Jimmy Bond and drummer Albert Ã¢â‚¬Å“TootieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Heath, she also sounds fine on a few instrumentals. Ã¢â‚¬Å“SummertimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is performed twice, once as a vocal. From the start of her career, Nina Simone carved out her own unique niche, meshing together her classical piano technique with folk singing, civil rights protest lyrics and jazz. All of those elements are in evidence on this highly recommended set.\n\n01. Black Is The Color Of My True LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hair 03:32\n02. Exactly Like You 03:16\n03. The Other Woman 02:59\n04. Under The Lowest 05:33\n05. You Can Have Him 05:54\n06. Summertime (Instrumental) 02:56\n07. Summertime 02:45\n08. Cotton Eyed Joe 02:56\n09. Return Home 05:27\n10. Wild Is The Wind 03:38\n11. Fine And Mellow 03:26\n\n1961 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Forbidden Fruit\n\n01. Rags And Old Iron 04:09\n02. No Good Man 03:39\n03. Gin House Blues 03:04\n04. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Look Around 05:04\n05. I Love To Love 03:24\n06. Work Song 02:35\n07. Where Can I Go Without You 02:52\n08. Just Say I Love Him (English Version) 06:35\n09. Memphis In June 02:39\n10. Forbidden Fruit 03:47\n\n1962 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nina Simone Sings Ellington\n\nNina Simone was on her way to becoming a major name by 1962, with her protest and civil rights songs giving her acclaim and recognition far beyond the jazz world. This CD reissue is a change of pace for the singer/pianist, who is heard performing 11 songs written by Duke Ellington and/or Billy Strayhorn. Backed by an unidentified string orchestra (the accompaniment is often sparse) and the Malcolm Dodds Singers, she not only revives the usual Duke hits but such obscurities as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey, Buddy Bolden,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Merry Mending,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Better Know It.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ None of these performances sound like the typical treatment of Ellington material, with Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Got It BadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ having a gospel feel, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Something to Live ForÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ being brief but heartfelt, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Like the SunriseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounding like a big production number, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Satin DollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ being taken as an instrumental. The brevity of this CD is unfortunate and this project should have been combined with another former LP, but what is here is quite intriguing and original.\n\n01. Do NothinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Till You Hear From Me 02:50\n02. I Got It Bad 04:07\n03. Hey, Buddy Bolden 02:27\n04. Merry Mending 02:36\n05. Something To Live For 02:56\n06. You Better Know It 02:25\n07. I Like The Sunrise 03:01\n08. Solitude 03:46\n09. The Gal From JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 02:12\n10. Satin Doll 03:37\n11. It DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mean A Thing 02:33\n\n1964 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Folksy Nina\n\nLike the 1963 LP Nina Simone at Carnegie Hall, this was recorded at Carnegie Hall on May 12, 1963, but duplicates little of the material found on that prior album. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just unworthy leftovers, but a strong set in its own right, concentrating on material that could be seen as traditional or folk in orientation. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not exactly strictly folk music, in repertoire or arrangement (which includes piano, guitar, bass, and drums, though not every tune has all of the instruments); Ã¢â‚¬Å“Twelfth of NeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (which had also appeared on the Carnegie Hall LP) certainly isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t folk music. However, there was also an uptempo piano blues, LeadbellyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silver City BoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; covers of the Israeli Ã¢â‚¬Å“Erets Zavat ChalavÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“VanetihuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which served as further proof that SimoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eclecticism knew no bounds; and the stark, moody, spiritually shaded ballads at which she excelled (Ã¢â‚¬Å“When I Was a Young Girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hush Little BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lass of the Low CountryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is as exquisitely sad-yet-beautiful as it gets. The album has been combined with another Colpix LP, Nina Simone with Strings, on a single-disc CD reissue by Collectables.\n\n01. Silver City Bound 05:05\n02. When I Was A Young Girl 06:03\n03. Erets Zavat Chalav 04:18\n04. Lass Of The Low Country 06:07\n05. The Young Night 05:32\n06. Twelfth Of Never 03:27\n07. Vanetihu 02:29\n08. Mighty Lak A Rose 03:04\n09. Hush Little Baby 04:06\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5CD set collects five of her original albums, in card LP replica sleeves. Features Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Amazing Nina SimoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1959), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nina Simone At Town HallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1959), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Forbidden FruitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1960), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nina Simone Sings EllingtonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1962) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Folksy NinaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1964).\nNina Simone was one of the most gifted vocalists of her generation, and also one of the most eclectic. Simone was a singer, pianist, and songwriter who bent genres to her will rather than allowing herself to be confined by their boundaries; her work swung back and forth between jazz, blues, soul, R&amp;B, pop, gospel, and world music, with passion, emotional honesty, and a strong grasp of technique as the constants of her musical career. Nina was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina on February 21, 1933.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n",
