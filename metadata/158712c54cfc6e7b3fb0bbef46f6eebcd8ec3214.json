HDClone is a perfect tool for backups and creating copies of entire software or operating system installations. A special SafeRescue mode makes HDClone an invaluable tool for rescuing defective hard disks and other media. HDClone works independent of partitioning scheme, file system, and operating system. It also works with proprietary formats which would otherwise be inaccessible.\n\nWhat's new in version 5.1.4:\n- TRIM in Windows brings the powerful SSD optimization, already known from the self-booting HDClone/S, to HDClone/W, making it available when cloning in Windows.\n- HDClone/W now can make use of up to 4 GB of RAM (instead of 2 GB before), improving total performance, especially in case of large disks.\n- The way to select partitions has been clearly improved and made more intuitive: if only particular partitions of a disk are to be copied, it is now possible to pick them directly from the list.\n- Moreover, disk and image lists can now be scrolled using the mouse wheel.\n- HDClone creates VHD images now about 10% faster than before.\n\nHomepage: www.miray.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158712c54cfc6e7b3fb0bbef46f6eebcd8ec3214","amp;dn":"HDClone+Enterprise+Edition+5.1.4+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158712c54cfc6e7b3fb0bbef46f6eebcd8ec3214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,135,18,197,76,252,110,123,63,176,187,239,70,246,238,188,216,236,50,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
