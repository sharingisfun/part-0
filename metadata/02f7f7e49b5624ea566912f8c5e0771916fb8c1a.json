It is the complete synth so please uninstall any previous versions.\n\nWhat's new:\n- New preset browser with 4 columns: Bankname, Type, Subtype, Mode\n- Changed preset file format - files are now called .nmsv\n- Batch file conversion from .ksd to .nmsv added to File menu\n- Import option for single .ksd files added to File menu\n- File open/save only works with .nmsv files files from now\n- Plugin states will be recalled in host, but saved in new format\n=&gt; reopening projects saved with Massive 1.3 will require 1.3 or higher\n\nThe new file-name extension means that you'll have to batch convert all the ksd patches. This does not delete or change your old ksd patches - it leaves them intact. Run the batch convert in stand-alone mode. \n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    Mount or burn with your favorite virtual drive\n\n    Run setup\n\n    Done.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nWindows 7 (latest Service Pack, 32/64 Bit) or Windows XP , Intel Core Duo or AMD Athlon 64, 2 GB RAM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f7f7e49b5624ea566912f8c5e0771916fb8c1a","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+Massive+STANDALONE+VSTi+RTAS+v1.3.0+x86+x64+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f7f7e49b5624ea566912f8c5e0771916fb8c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,247,247,228,155,86,36,234,86,105,18,248,197,224,119,25,22,251,140,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
