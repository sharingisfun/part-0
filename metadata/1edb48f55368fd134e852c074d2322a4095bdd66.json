Little Shadow\n\n\nTitle: It's Blitz\nArtist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs\nStore Date: 13 apr 2009\nUpload Date: 23 feb 2009\nLabel: Interscope\nGenre: Indie\nCover: front\nBitrate: 192 kb/s, stereo\n\n\nThe trio recorded It's Blitz! with two producers: TV on the Radio's David Sitek, who did production work on the last two albums, and Nick Launay, who co-produced the 2007 Is Is EP along with the band. But the band didn't do everything the same. For one thing, guitarist Nick Zinner plays a whole lot of vintage synths on this thing. For another, according to a press release, the band began the writing process &quot;in the middle of a snowstorm, in a hundred-year-old barn in rural Massachusetts.&quot; So that probably messed with their formula a bit.\n\n",
