  "description": "Negotiation Genius: How to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Brilliant Results at the Bargaining Table and Beyond by Deepak Malhotra, Max Bazerman\r\nEnglish | 2008 | ISBN: 0553384112, 055380488X | 352 pages | EPUB | 644 KB\r\n\r\nFrom two leaders in executive education at Harvard Business School, here are the mental habits and proven strategies you need to achieve outstanding results in any negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhether youâ€™ve â€œseen it allâ€ or are just starting out, Negotiation Genius will dramatically improve your negotiating skills and confidence. Drawing on decades of behavioral research plus the experience of thousands of business clients, the authors take the mystery out of preparing for and executing negotiationsâ€”whether they involve multimillion-dollar deals or improving your next salary offer.\r\n\r\nWhat sets negotiation geniuses apart? They are the men and women who know how to:\r\n\r\nâ€¢Identify negotiation opportunities where others see no room for discussion\r\n\r\nâ€¢Discover the truth even when the other side wants to conceal it\r\n\r\nâ€¢Negotiate successfully from a position of weakness\r\n\r\nâ€¢Defuse threats, ultimatums, lies, and other hardball tactics\r\n\r\nâ€¢Overcome resistance and â€œsellâ€ proposals using proven influence tactics\r\n\r\nâ€¢Negotiate ethically and create trusting relationshipsâ€”along with great deals\r\n\r\nâ€¢Recognize when the best move is to walk away\r\n\r\nâ€¢And much, much more",
