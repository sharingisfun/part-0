Like Tarantino's other movie soundtracks like Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill, it combines a few great songs that were past hits with tracks that most music listeners have never heard before. Unlike those soundtracks, Pulp Fiction is great from beginning to end with the more obscure tracks being arguably better than the more established songs.\n\nAll of the tracks here that were past hits are very strong. Kool &amp; The Gang's &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; is one of the best funk jams from the '70s. Al Green's &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot; is '70s soul at its best. Chuck Berry's &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;, Dusty Springfield's &quot;Son Of A Preacher Man&quot;, Ricky Nelson's &quot;Lonesome Town&quot;, and the Statler Brothers' &quot;Flowers On The Wall&quot; with its catchy chorus are also great tracks. Any movie soundtrack containing these tracks would be pretty good. But what really puts this album over the top are the more obscure tracks or &quot;deep cuts.&quot; Dick Dale's &quot;Misirlou&quot; is a killer track that resurrected the surf guitar king's career. Urge Overkill's version of Neil Diamond's &quot;Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon&quot; is an outstanding track which is even better than the original. The tracks &quot;Bustin' Surfboards&quot; and &quot;Surf Rider&quot; are also great. But it's the somber acoustic track &quot;If Love Is A Red Dress&quot; with Maria McKee's fantastic vocal performace and whistling hook that steals the show. The snippets from the movie are some of its best moments, especially &quot;Royale With Cheese&quot; and Samuel Jackson's closing &quot;Ezekiel 25:17.&quot; The tracks are also sequenced very well, never putting songs from the same genre or mood together. All told, this is a great soundtrack to what was arguably one of the best movies of the '90s. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df9924ed98cbce224334c3a4dce940beada3d438","amp;dn":"Pulp+Fiction+-+Soundtrack+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df9924ed98cbce224334c3a4dce940beada3d438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,153,36,237,152,203,206,34,67,52,195,164,220,233,64,190,173,163,212,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
