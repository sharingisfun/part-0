The Arrow) left Starling City with the hopes of beginning a new life. But will Oliver ever truly be able to leave behind his past as the Arrow, and, if so, what becomes of the team he has worked so hard to assemble? Will Diggle, Thea, and Laurel be left to continue Oliverâ€™s crusade without him? And with Malcolm Merlyn having ascended to the top of the League of Assassins as the new Ra's al Ghul, is anyone really safe?\r\n\r\n\r\nStars: Stephen Amell,Katie Cassidy,David Ramsey,Willa Holland,Emily Bett Rickards,John Barrowman,Paul Blackthorne,Neal McDonough \r\n\r\n\r\n#   Episode name                        Original airdate\r\n\r\n1   Green Arrow                          October 7, 2015\r\n2   The Candidate                        October 14, 2015\r\n3   Restoration                          October 21, 2015\r\n4   Beyond Redemption                    October 28, 2015\r\n5   Haunted                              November 4, 2015\r\n6   Lost Souls                           November 11, 2015\r\n7   Brotherhood                          November 18, 2015\r\n8   Legends of Yesterday (2)             December 2, 2015\r\n9   Dark Waters                          December 9, 2015\r\n10  Blood Debts                          January 20, 2016\r\n11  A.W.O.L.
