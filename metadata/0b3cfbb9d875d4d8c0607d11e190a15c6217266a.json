Play\nPLEASE REMEMBER TO SEED, MANY OTHERS WANT THIS GAME! :)\nIf you like this game, support the developers and BUY IT!\n\nTitle: SATELLITE REIGN\nGenre: Action - Strategy - Sci-fi\nWorks on: Windows (7, 8)\nLanguages: Audio and text: English\nModes: Single-player\nReleased: August 28, 2015\nSize: 560 MB\nCompany: 5 Lives Studios / 5 Lives Studios\nStore page: https://www.gog.com/game/satellite_reign\n\nAbout:\nSatellite Reign is a real-time, class-based strategy game. You control a team of four agents, each with distinct and unique abilities, collectively battling for control of a simulated, living cyberpunk city.\nCustomise your team with the strength to destroy your enemies head-on, or hack into their facilities to manipulate their infrastructure without them ever knowing you were even there.\nWill you take down your enemies with brute-force? Covert espionage and infiltration? Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers?\nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe. The time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack, kill and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve? To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves? That, is up to you.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 or later\nProcessor: x86 Dual Core 2.4 GHz \nMemory: 3 GB RAM \nGraphics: DirectX 9 GPU with 1GB of memory \nDirectX: Version 9.0c \nHard Drive: 2 GB available space\n\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 or later\nProcessor: x86 Quad Core 3.4GHz or greater \nMemory: 4 GB RAM \nGraphics: DirectX 11 GPU with 2GB of memory \nDirectX: Version 11 \nHard Drive: 2 GB available space",
