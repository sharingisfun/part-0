  "description": "Overcoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymnastics and Bodyweight Strength \nby Steven Low and Valentin Uzunov \nCreateSpace Independent Publishing | November 2011 | ISBN-10: 1467933120 | PDF | 542 pages | 71.3 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/1467933120&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/1467933120&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOvercoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymnastics and Bodyweight Strength is a 542 page comprehensive guide to the most overlooked, yet most powerful elements of strength training.\nIn this book, Steven Low takes the reader on a journey through logically and systematically constructing a strength oriented bodyweight workout routine. With a highly systematic and scientific approach, Steven delves into the exercise physiology behind strength training and how to adequately prepare the body for the rigors of bodyweight training. Using the same rigor and attention to detail, Overcoming Gravity also includes recommendations for all bodyweight athletes concerning health and injury management. Unlike other books on this topic, it provides extremely comprehensive sample programming to assist in the design of a well-balanced routine, including information about the proper execution of the exercises and techniques.\nIf you prefer your books on fitness and health to include data, science and effective recommendations, then Overcoming Gravity is an ideal addition to your library.\nNote: This book contains no bodyweight leg exercises, or primary gymnastics work (cartwheels, tumbling, swings, giants, etc.). It is devoted solely toward upper body strength and skill development with gymnastics exercises.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction \nPart I - How to construct your own workout rouline\nChapter 1 laying the foundation\nChapter 2: The basics of tile physiology of strength\nChapter 3: Setting and achieving goals\nChapter 4: Maintaining ,tructural balance\nChapter 5: Skill and strength progression chans\nChapter 6: The basic hierarchy of a routine\nChapter 7: Structuring the routinc\nChapter 8: Programming\nChapter 9: Programming and advancing\nChapter 10: A brief look at overreaching and overtraining\nChapter 11.
