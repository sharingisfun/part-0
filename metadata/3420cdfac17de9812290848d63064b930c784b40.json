  "description": "\nBusiness Intelligence For Dummies By Swain Scheps\n2008 | 388 Pages | ISBN: 0470127236 | PDF | \n\n\nYou're intelligent, right? So you've already figured out that Business Intelligence can be pretty valuable in making the right decisions about your business. But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard at least a dozen definitions of what it is, and heard of at least that many BI tools. Where do you start?\nBusiness Intelligence For Dummies makes BI understandable! It takes you step by step through the technologies and the alphabet soup, so you can choose the right technology and implement a successful BI environment. You'll see how the applications and technologies work together to access, analyze, and present data that you can use to make better decisions about your products, customers, competitors, and more.",
