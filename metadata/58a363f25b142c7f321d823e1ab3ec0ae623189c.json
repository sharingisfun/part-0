This version is the full, complete PRO version that does not expire after 8 hours.  This torrent includes the full coloor PDF version of \\&quot;The SketchUp Book 5\\&quot; by Bonnie Roskes (http://www.f1help.biz/ccp51/cgi-bin/cp-app.cgi), an excellent book that teaches every function of SketchUp in a step-by-step process.  This torrent also includes all the premade objects (people, things, buildings, etc) for download from SketchUp.  Also included is the KeyGen program to unlock setup.  You can also download thousands upon thousands of pre-made objects from Google\\&amp;#039;s 3D warehouse (http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse) to speed up the design of your project.  \n\nIf you have a need to design items such as a deck, a new product, an art project, etc - SketchUp is the program for you.  I really can\\&amp;#039;t recommend SketchUp enough!\n\nTo get started I would recommend printing out the PDF book (isn\\&amp;#039;t that why we have color laser printers at work?) and going step-by-step through the book to get an idea of how to make SketupUp do what you want it to do.
