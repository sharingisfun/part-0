  "description": "The Offspring\nGreatest Hits\n\nFormat: Mp3\nGenre: Alternative\nRelease Date: 2005\nLabel: Sony\nSize: 115 MB\nSource: World Wide Web\n\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate: 44.1 Khz\nSample Size: 16 Bit\nBit Rate: 320 kbps\nM3U File: Yes\n\nAudio Quality: Very High (Lossy)\nEncoder: LAME3.82U\nEncoder Settings: Constant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains: Album Art, ID Tag ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1\n\nThe Offspring are an American pop-punk band best known for their hits &quot;Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)&quot; and &quot;Why Don't You Get a Job?&quot;.\n\nOriginally called Manic Subsidal, by the time the band had adopted the name 'The Offspring' in 1985 they had already seen a few line-up changes. After the release of the single &quot;Blackball/I'll Be Waiting&quot; and a demo in 1988, they released a limited run of The Offspring (which was finally released in CD format in 1995). A further EP Baghdad was released in 1991 and Ignition was released a year later. They toured for two years with the album and on their return to the studio they recorded Smash. The album gave the band their breakthrough, helped in large part by the success of the singles &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;. It sold over six million in the US, and was later declared the biggest-selling independently released album ever.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Can't Repeat\n02.Come Out And Play (Keep 'Em Separated)\n03.Self Esteem\n04.Gotta Get Away\n05.All I Want\n06.Gone Away\n07.Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)\n08.Why Don't You Get A Job\n09.The Kids Aren't Alright\n10.Original Prankster\n11.Want You Bad\n12.Defy You\n13.Hit That\n14.(Can't Get My) Head Around You\n\nCheers!",
