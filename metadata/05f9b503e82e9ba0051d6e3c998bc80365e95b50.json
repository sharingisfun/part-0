  "description": "Finish Your Book in Three Drafts - How to Write a Book, Revise a Book and Complete a Book While You Still Love It (2016) (Epub) Gooner\r\n\r\nPublisher: Book Architecture (6 Jun. 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0986420425\r\nISBN-13: 978-0986420429\r\n\r\nHow do you write a book? Stuart Horwitz helps you do it in three drafts. Three drafts: that's all you need.\r\n\r\n- The messy draft: which is all about getting it down.\r\n\r\n- The method draft: which is all about making sense.\r\n\r\n- The polished draft: which is all about making it good.\r\n\r\nFinish Your Book in Three Drafts is for outliners who meticulously script every writing session and pantsers who pilot solely by feel. It will help you get past the fear that can land a first draft in the trashcan, and the confusion that can send a second draft into a dizzying tailspin. Because you don't want to be writing the same book for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nYou can Finish Your Book in Three Drafts provided you approach each draft in the right spirit, and know what action steps to take between drafts. With clarity, honesty, humor, and even videos, Horwitz discusses the best outlook and direction for each of the three drafts so that you can increase your efficiency, satisfaction, and engagement with both your writing process and your final product",
