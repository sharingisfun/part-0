Van Hoogstraten drew on a variety of literary, philosophical, and artistic sources, as well as from history and travel accounts, in writing has magnum opus, Introduction to the Academy of Painting; or the Visible World (1678) a cross-section of general seventeenth-century views on art in Holland. Questioning the motives of artists represented by van Hoogstratenâ€™s theory, as well as the contested issues behind Dutch realism and its hidden symbolism, author Thijs Weststeijn provides an ambitious overview of seventeenth-century painting through the eyes of contemporary Dutch artists from the age.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface and acknowledgements 9\r\nIntroduction 11\r\nI. samuel van hoogstraten in the republic of letters 25\r\nII. the visible world 83\r\nIII. pictorial imitation 123\r\nIV. the depiction of the passions 171\r\nV. the eloquence of colour 219\r\nVI. painting as a mirror of nature 269\r\nExcursus: painting as a â€˜sister of philosophyâ€™ 329\r\nConclusion 353\r\nNotes 361\r\nBibliography 443\r\nIndices 463\r\n \nhttp://s13.postimg.org/xfa8tjqnr/The_Visible_World.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af83dfb7367978eda6abd6761617d2593c6eddb9","amp;dn":"The+Visible+World+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af83dfb7367978eda6abd6761617d2593c6eddb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,131,223,183,54,121,120,237,166,171,214,118,22,23,210,89,60,110,221,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
