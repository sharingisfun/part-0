  "description": "Crypt of the NecroDancer is a hardcore roguelike rhythm game. Can you survive this deadly dungeon of dance, slay the NecroDancer, and recapture your still beating heart? Or will you be a slave to the rhythm for all eternity?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/SbB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gifyu.com/image/SbB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeatures:\n-Move on the beat to navigate ever changing dungeons while battling dancing skeletons, zombies, dragons, and more!\n-Groove to the game's epic Danny Baranowsky soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection!\n-Play with keyboard, controller, or even a USB dance pad!\n\nWhy Early Access?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Earlier in the year we released an alpha build to everyone who pre-ordered, and the feedback we received on that build helped us to vastly improve the game. We're excited to release via Early Access because we know Crypt of the NecroDancer is going to improve greatly as a result. Our community is amazing!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nHow long will this game be in Early Access?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We plan to finish zone 4 and the final bosses in 2014. However, if the game proves to be popular we hope to continue to add additional features beyond that. We are having a great time developing this game and we want to keep on improving it!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nHow is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The full version will include zone 4, the final boss battles, as well as more playable characters.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nWhat is the current state of the Early Access version?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The current version includes zones 1, 2, and 3. It also includes 4 of the 8 playable characters. Many fans have racked up hundreds of hours of playtime already, so there's no shortage of fun to be had with this current version!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nWill the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The game's price will not change.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nHow are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We've already taken many suggestions from the community and incorporated them in the game. By expanding our community via Early Access we look forward to doing this even more!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ",
