The player, as Mario or Luigi, is able to defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers.\n\nMario and Luigi are given a wider range of abilities than in previous Super Mario games, including flying or sliding down slopes. In addition, Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces numerous elements, such as new enemy characters and the use of a world map to transition between levels, that have reappeared in or have influenced subsequent Mario games.\n\nMore info:\n\nNot available on Google Play Store.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ac1e9fb84a728b32ef953075c203e47c25069d3","amp;dn":"Super+Mario+Bros+3+for+Android+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ac1e9fb84a728b32ef953075c203e47c25069d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,193,233,251,132,167,40,179,46,249,83,7,92,32,62,71,194,80,105,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
