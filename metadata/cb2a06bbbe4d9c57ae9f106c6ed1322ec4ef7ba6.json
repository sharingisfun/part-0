The band is commonly classified as hard rock and are considered pioneers of heavy metal, though they themselves have always classified their music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;. To date they are one of the highest grossing bands of all time. AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but Scott's parents urged them to continue and hire a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released their highest selling album, and ultimately the second highest-selling album by any band, Back in Black.\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by future Dio drummer Simon Wright, though the band resurged in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 (after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1994, was asked to leave in favour of him) and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Since then, the band's line-up has remained the same. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics, and the band's latest studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those\nAbout to Rock, reaching No.1 on all the charts eventually.As of 2010, AC/DC have sold more than 200 million albums worldwide, as of the releases of their latest albums, Black Ice and the Iron Man 2 soundtrack, including 71 million albums in the United States. Back in Black has sold an estimated 49 million units worldwide, making it the highest-selling album by any band and the second-highest-selling album in history, behind Thriller by Michael Jackson. The album has sold 22 million in the US alone, where it is the fifth-highest-selling album. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; and were named the seventh &quot;Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time&quot; by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC were ranked number 72 in the Rolling Stone list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;\n\n.: AC-DC Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/1104/acdcpraying1024x76812.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/1104/acdcpraying1024x76812.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1974 High Voltage (Australian Editions) @320\n1975 T.N.T (Australian Editions) @320\n1976 Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (Australian Relise Only) @320\n1976 High Voltage (Japan Remasters) @320\n1977 Let There Be Rock (Australian Editions) @320\n1978 Powerage (Australian Editions) @320\n1979 Highway To Hell (Australian Editions) @320\n1980 Back In Black (Australian Editions) @320\n1981 For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)(Australian Editions) @320\n1983 Flick Of The Switch (Australian Editions) @320\n1985 Fly On The Wall (Australian Editions) @320\n1988 Blow Up Your Video (Australian Editions) @320\n1990 The Razor's Edge (Australian Editions) @320\n1995 Ballbreaker @320\n2000 Stiff Upper Lip @320\n2008 Black Ice @320\n\nLive albums\n1977 Live From The Atlantic Studio @320\n1978 If You Want Blood You've Got It (Australian Editions) @320\n1979 Let There Be Rock-The Movie-Live In Paris @320\n1992 Live (Collector's Edition, 2 CD)(Australian Editions) @320\n1992 Live @320\n\nSoundtrack albums\n1986 Who Made Who (Australian Editions) @320\n1993 Last Action Hero (OST) @320\n\nExtended plays\n1984 '74 Jailbreak @320\n\nBoxsets\n1997 Bonfire (5 CD Box Set, 2003 Remaster)(Australian Editions) @320\nCD1-Live From The Atlantic Studios\nCD2-Let There Be Rock - Live In Paris (Part 1)\nCD3-Let There Be Rock - Live In Paris (Part 2)\nCD4-Volts\nCD5-Back In Black\n2009 Backtracks (Rarities)(Australian Editions, 2 CD) @320\nCD1 Studio Rarities\nCD2 Live Rarities\n\nSingles (some)\n1986 Who Made Who @320\n1988 Heatseeke @320\n1990 Moneytalks @320\n1990 Thunderstruck @320\n1993 Big Gun @320\n2000 Stiff Upper Lip (Germany) @320\n\nCompilations\n2000 The Best (2 CD) @320\n2003 Platinum Collection @320\n2004 Greatest Hits 30 Anniversary Edition (2 CD) @320\n2007 The Definitive Collection (Volume I) - The Best Of Bon (2 CD) @320\n2008 Greatest Hits (2 CD) @320\nCD1 Brian Johnson\nCD2 Bon Scott\n\nOther albums (Live archives, Bootlegs, Tributes)\n1974 In The Beginning Vol. 1 (with Dave Evans) @320\n1977 Live At Cleveland Agora @320\n1977 Live At The Old Waldorf In San Francisco @320\n1979 Dirty Big Balls @320\n1979 Highway To Hammersmith @320\n1979 Route 666 Vol II @320\n1979 She's Got Balls @320\n1982 Electric Shock @320\n1983 Live USA (1977-83, 2 CD) @320\n1985 Fly On Tour (Live Archive) @320\n1986 Goteborg Sweden (2 CD) @320\n1986 To Be A Fly On The Wall (2 CD) @320\n1991 Rare Rarer Rarities (UnOfficial Rarities)(320)\n1992 Thunder Boogie (LP Bootleg) @320\n1999 Backfire - The Rare Tracks (1980-1988) @320\n2000 Sessions Rarities B-Sides Vol 1 (Rare) @320\n2000 Shooting From The Hip @320\n2003 All My Friends Are Gonna Be There Too @320\n2008 Black Philly Ice (2 CD) @320\n2008 For Those About To Xcel (2 CD) @320\n2008 Freezing Point @320\n2008 Live In Oakland (2 CD) @320\n2008 Second Allstate Station (2 CD) @320\n2009 21st Century Rock (77'- Tribute to AC-DC) @320\n2009 Ahoy (Bootleg, Rotterdam 13-03-09, 2 CD) @320\n2009 It Smells Rock 'N' Roll (2 CD) @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2a06bbbe4d9c57ae9f106c6ed1322ec4ef7ba6","amp;dn":"AC-DC+-+Discography+1974-2009+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb2a06bbbe4d9c57ae9f106c6ed1322ec4ef7ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,42,6,187,190,77,156,87,174,159,16,108,110,209,50,46,196,239,123,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
