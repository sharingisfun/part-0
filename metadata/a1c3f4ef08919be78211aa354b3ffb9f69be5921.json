  "description": "Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/\n\nMonty Python's Life of Brian, also known as Life of Brian, is a 1979 comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team. It tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Graham Chapman), a young Jewish man who is born in the same era and location as Jesus Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.\n\nThe film contains themes of religious satire which were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the UK either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate (effectively preventing the film from being shown as the distributors said the film could not be shown unless it was unedited and carried the original AA (14) certificate). Certain countries banned its showing, with a few of these bans lasting decades.\n\nThe film was a box-office success, grossing fourth-highest of any film in the UK in 1979 and highest of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular since then, receiving positive reviews and being named 'Greatest British comedy film of all time' by several magazines and television networks.\n\nDirected by\t:Terry Jones\nStarring\t:Graham Chapman,John Cleese,Terry Gilliam\n                :Eric Idle,Terry Jones,Michael Palin\nRelease date(s)\t:17 August 1979\nRunning time\t:94 minutes\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 33mn 44s 40ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : DVD5\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Comedy\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 903 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 336 (1.905) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb",
