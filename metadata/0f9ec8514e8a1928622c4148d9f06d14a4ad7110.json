  "description": "Release Name: Beirut-No_No_No-2015-C4\nSize: 62.1 MB\nGenre: Indie\nLabel: 4AD\n\nAlbum Review:\n\nBeirutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth full-length album, No No No, has songwriter/singer Zach Condon swaying away from 2011Ã¢â‚¬Â²s more indie pop The Rip Tide back toward the European folk-infused eccentricity of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first two LPs, and hanging out somewhere in between. With a flock of instruments ranging from piano, guitars, bass, and percussion to brass, strings, ukulele, and a selection of vintage synths and electronic organs, the songs are rarely sparse and often whimsical Ã¢â‚¬â€ a diversion from more typical indie rock fare, as has been CondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s calling card since the beginning. While there are several electronic instruments on No No No, the experience is that of an acoustic jamboree. The bouncy opening track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gibraltar,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for instance, highlights bongo-type drumming, piano, handclaps, and CondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctive, humming vocal tone over synths. The serene instrumental interlude, Ã¢â‚¬Å“As Needed,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ actually is entirely acoustic. Synthesizers and organs are much more prevalent on the title track, including its Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s video game-like intro and rhythmic keyboard intervals, but it still plays like a roaming street band, with colorful brass, hand-held percussion, and Eastern European folk scales. Elsewhere, Ã¢â‚¬Å“FenerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a bright, celeste-stippled tune, and the laid-back Ã¢â‚¬Å“August HollandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and strolling Ã¢â‚¬Å“PerthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are mellow but with churning grooves befitting pre-Saturday night rituals. The overall effect of the album is similarly steady and reflective yet toe-tapping. A perhaps surprising tone not reflective of CondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turbulent personal life during the four-year break since The Rip Tide, which included divorce and hospitalization, No No No is a feel-good mean of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prior releases that should appeal to the Beirut loyal as well as serve as a fine representative for any potential admirers whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve simply managed to miss them along the way.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
