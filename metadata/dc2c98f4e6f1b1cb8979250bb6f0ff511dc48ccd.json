  "description": "\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald\nGreatest Hits (2008)\n\n\n\n\n&quot;The First Lady of Song,&quot; Ella Fitzgerald was arguably the finest female jazz singer of all time (although some may vote for Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holiday). Blessed with a beautiful voice and a wide range, Fitzgerald could outswing anyone, was a brilliant scat singer, and had near-perfect elocution; one could always understand the words she sang. The one fault was that, since she always sounded so happy to be singing, Fitzgerald did not always dig below the surface of the lyrics she interpreted and she even made a downbeat song such as &quot;Love for Sale&quot; sound joyous. However, when one evaluates her career on a whole, there is simply no one else in her class.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Cheek To Cheek\n02.Lullaby Of Birdland\n03.How High The Moon\n04.Summertime (Feat.
