In this epic adventure from J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions and &quot;Supernatural's&quot; Eric Kripke, a family struggles to reunite in an American landscape where every single piece of technology - computers, planes, cars, phones, even lights - has mysteriously blacked out forever. A drama with sweeping scope and intimate focus, &quot;Revolution&quot; is also about family - both the family you're born into and the family you choose. This is a swashbuckling journey of hope and rebirth seen through the eyes of one strong-willed young woman, Charlie Matheson (Tracy Spiridakos, &quot;Being Human&quot;), and her brother Danny (Graham Rogers, &quot;Memphis Beat&quot;). When Danny is kidnapped by militia leaders for a darker purpose, Charlie must reconnect with her estranged uncle Miles (Billy Burke, &quot;The Twilight Saga&quot;), a former U.S. Marine living a reclusive life. Together, with a rogue band of survivors, they set out to rescue Danny, overthrow the militia and ultimately re-establish the United States of America. All the while, they explore the enduring mystery of why the power failed, and if - or how - it will ever return.\n\nThe series also stars Anna Lise Phillips (&quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;) as Maggie, Zak Orth (&quot;Romeo + Juliet) as Aaron, JD Pardo (&quot;A Cinderella Story&quot;) as Nate, Giancarlo Esposito (&quot;Breaking Bad&quot;) as Captain Tom Neville, David Lyons (&quot;The Cape&quot;) as Bass, Maria Howell (&quot;The Blind Side&quot;) as Grace, Daniella Alonso (&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;) as Nora, Tim Guinee (&quot;Iron Man&quot;) as Ben Matheson and Elizabeth Mitchell (&quot;Lost&quot;) as Rachel Matheson. Kripke, Abrams and Bryan Burk (&quot;Lost,&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot;) serve as executive producers, and Jon Favreau (&quot;Iron Man,&quot; &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;) serves as co-executive producer. &quot;Revolution&quot; is produced by Bonanza Productions Inc. in association with Bad Robot Productions, Kripke Enterprises and Warner Bros. Television. The pilot was directed by Favreau.\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 4 / Version 2\nOverall bit rate                         : 999 Kbps\nWriting application                      : mkvmerge v6.2.0 ('Promised Land') built on Apr 28 2013 12:22:01\nWriting library                          : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.0\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4008292728000c746e71&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 14 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nNominal bit rate                         : 777 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.035\nWriting library                          : x264 core 130 r2273 b3065e6\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nBitrate                                  : 222kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nMenu\n00:00:00.097                             : en:00:00:00.097\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78b35581d0106527fced001498ce7c602a56b5ce","amp;dn":"Revolution+Season+1+-+COMPLETE+%5BMKV%2CAAC%2C5+1%5D+Ehhhh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78b35581d0106527fced001498ce7c602a56b5ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,179,85,129,208,16,101,39,252,237,0,20,152,206,124,96,42,86,181,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
