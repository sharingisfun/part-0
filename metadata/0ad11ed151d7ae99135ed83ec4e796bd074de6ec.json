To top it all off, she's developed a disturbing habit of eating her own flesh. Novella desperately tries to hide her strange condition from her motherly landlord, Eesha, and somewhat psychopathic best friend, Candice, but her body and mind continue to deteriorate in the depressing world of failed auditions and sketchy night clubs. Can a romantic relationship with her psychiatrist prevent her from self destruction? Or will her fatal habit continue to eat away at her? \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad11ed151d7ae99135ed83ec4e796bd074de6ec","amp;dn":"Eat+%282014%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad11ed151d7ae99135ed83ec4e796bd074de6ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,209,30,209,81,215,174,153,19,94,216,62,196,231,150,189,7,77,230,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
