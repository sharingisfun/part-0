A lot of attention to using otherwise &quot;dead&quot; space for inventive storage, and like all of Sunset's how-to books, clear illustrations and great photographs make theoretical ideas easy to imagine, plan, and realize in your own home\n============\n\nCheap Home Decor: Crafting with Paper\n\nPaper is one of the best materials to craft with because it's everywhere. You can do paper crafts with computer paper, notebook paper, tissue paper, newspaper, and, of course, scrapbook paper. Scrapbooking and card making are increasingly popular pastimes for crafters, but lately people have been looking for other ways to craft with paper. After all, who wants to spend all that time perfecting a scrapbook layout only to have it shoved into a book and stored on a shelf? It's much more beneficial to display your crafts in your home! The benefits are twofold: you get to display the crafts that you toiled over (and you should be proud of them!) and you also get cheap, easy, and personalized home decor too, all just by doing something you love--paper crafting. \n\n=======================\n\nShop Drawings for Craftsman Furniture: 27 Stickley Designs for Every Room in the Home\n\nby Robert W Langbaum (Author) , Robert W Lang  (Author)\nPublisher: Fox Chapel Publishing (October 1, 2001)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1892836122\nISBN-13: 978-1892836120\n\nFeaturing working shop drawings, this book demonstrates 27 pieces of authentic Craftsman household furniture by Gustav Stickley and his contemporaries.
