I have some video guides and offer support for installing this torrent. Due to not getting notices when I get comments here, you||tube is best way to contact me.\n==================================================================================\n\n***UPDATE 5/31/2010***\nyes this works on windows 7 32bit &amp; 64bit\nYes this works on vista 32bit. Never tested personally on vista 64bit, but from other comments on my you//tube account, yest it does\n\n\n***UPDATE 4/21/2010****\n\nSeems some users using PowerISO, have informed me the game mshows in the original Japanese language.  I specifically used Magic Disk or MagicISO to emulate the ISO. So if any language but English shows, try using one of the 2. MagicISO\nor MagicDisk\n\n\nGhostWarriorTheGeek is my You  Tube handle. Video guide for this torrent is there\n\n\n\n***UPDATED 544pm on November 14, 2009\nVIDEO INSTALL GUDIE\n\nseems the link is being disabled. so go to y o u tu b e &amp; paste the following at the end of url.\n\n\n/watch?v=UaH6L11ipBY\n\n***UPDATED 555pm same day\n\nyou t ube rejected video due to its 10 minute limit. video is 17 minutes long in mp4 format. ill edit it to fit said site later &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5162876&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5162876&lt;/a&gt;\nis where you can dl the video guide\n\n\nI originally downloaded this via a private site &amp; it was in Japanese. SO using Magic ISO, I edited the setup.ini file from its default language from 0411 to 0409, thus making it English for setup, install &amp; game play.\n\nThis torrent is not my creation. I simply converted the Japan/Chinese/Korean to English for those that could not install it previously due to the foreign language.\n\nTHANKS      xsaimex VIP. I hope my english version gets as many solid seeders! Not trying to steal your thunder, just a lover of noobies &amp; boobies as I been there done that before.:P\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTPB comments had a few noobs not able to install. I downloaded mine via a private site, but seems to be identical to this guys upload. He deserves the props, as he beat me to the upload, and has a great seeder count, but I decided to have a heart on the newbies \n\nThis torrent is not my creation. I simply converted the Japan/Chineese/Korean to English for those that could not install it previously due to the foreign language.\n\nGWpirateGW\nThe Tester/Converter Guy\nMY install notes\n\n1. Unrar. (extract to a folder on desktop or anywhere you choose)\n2. You will need a dvd that can support more than 4.6 gb or a dvd emulator, such as Magic ISO or Power ISO\n3. Mount or burn iso.\n4. Copy over the cracked content &amp; replace the orginal when asked. Default install directory should be here:\nC:Program FilesCAPCOMRESIDENT EVIL 5\n5. Play the Game &amp; enjoy.\n5. Please seed.\n6. Buy the game if you love it so much.\n7. seed it(noobies, simply do not remove it from your torrent client for a few days, so others may enjoy)\n8. say thanks\n\n\nGWpirateGW\nThe Tester/Converter Guy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5af19ce4b055375f0abfd4a3102765da4b03c73","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+5%28PC%29+English+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5af19ce4b055375f0abfd4a3102765da4b03c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,175,25,206,75,5,83,117,240,171,253,74,49,2,118,93,164,176,60,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
