But not for long as an all-new villain has surfaced from beneath the magical land, the Gnome King! Having captured the Good Witch, the Gnome King and his army are wreaking havoc throughout Oz and need but one item to take control of The Emerald City, Dorothy's ruby slippers! It's up to our favorite cat and mouse duo to team up, go Back to Oz and save the land they love. Take to the skies, courtesy of the Wizard himself, with Dorothy, Toto, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Lion as they make their magical journey. The laughs and adventure will roar as they encounter all-new frights and mischievous creatures down the Yellow Brick Road, 'cause &quot;we're not in Kansas anymore!&quot;\r\n\r\nDirector: Spike Brandt\r\nWriters: Spike Brandt, Sam Register\r\nStars: Amy Pemberton, Joe Alaskey, Michael Gough \r\nGenres: Animation\r\nCountry: USA\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: Tom.and.Jerry.Back.to.Oz.2016.DVDRip.XviD-EVO\r\n                                             \r\nSOURCE: DVD NTSC - Thanks King-DVD!                                             \r\n\r\nViDEO: 1700 Kbps\r\n\r\nRESOLUTiON: 720x400\r\n\r\nRUNTiME: 1h 20m 43s \r\n\r\nSUBTiTLES: No                             \r\n\r\nAUDiO: 128 kbps mp3      \r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\n SPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                 HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight, EMPEROR_DVD.      \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/agXh \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/agXb \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/agX3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dbd059c5ab0ce222b4489bdc1a045f43daabc86","amp;dn":"Tom.and.Jerry.Back.to.Oz.2016.DVDRip.XviD-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dbd059c5ab0ce222b4489bdc1a045f43daabc86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,189,5,156,90,176,206,34,43,68,137,189,193,160,69,244,61,170,188,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
