  "description": "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a sandbox-style action-adventure computer and video game developed by Rockstar North. It is the third 3D game in the Grand Theft Auto video game franchise and fifth original game overall. Originally released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004,[2] the game has since been ported to the Xbox and Microsoft Windows, and has received wide acclaim and high sales figures on all three platforms. San Andreas was succeeded by Grand Theft Auto IV and was preceded by Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\n\nThe game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, comprising three metropolitan cities. Set in late 1992,[9] San Andreas revolves around gang member Carl &quot;CJ&quot; Johnson returning home from Liberty City to Los Santos after learning of his mother's murder. CJ finds his family and his old gang, the Grove Street Families, in disarray. Over the course of the game, CJ gradually unravels the plot behind his mother's murder while reestablishing his gang and exploring his own business ventures. Like other games in the series, San Andreas is composed of elements from driving games and third-person shooters, and features &quot;open-world&quot; gameplay that gives the player more control over their playing experience. The game adds several features, such as gang wars, car customization, and character personalization.\n\n\n\nEnjoy............\n\n\n\nDDD\nD__D\nD__D\nD__D\nDDD\n\nEEEE\nE\nEEE\nE\nEEEE\n\n_SSS\nS\n_SSS\n____S\nSSSS\n\nPPPP\nP___P\nPPPP\nP\nP\n\nEEEE\nE\nEEE\nE\nEEEE\n\nRRRR\nR___R\nRRRR\nR_R\nR__RR\n\n_AA\nA__A\nAAAA\nA__A\nA__A\n\nTTTTTT\n__TT\n__TT\n__TT\n__TT\n\nEEEE\nE\nEEE\nE\nEEEE\n\n\n\n\nK__K\nK_K\nKK\nK_K\nK__K\n\nIII\n_I\n_I\n_I\nIII\n\nL\nL\nL\nL\nLLLL\n\nL\nL\nL\nL\nLLLL\n\nEEEE\nE\nEEE\nE\nEEEE\n\nRRRR\nR___R\nRRRR\nR_R\nR__RR\n\n\n[:)]\t",
