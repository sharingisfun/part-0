  "description": "Early Career, Controversy, &amp; First Hiatus (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1986)\n\nSuicidal Tendencies formed in 1981 as a punk band in Venice, California. The original lineup of the band consisted of Mike Muir on vocals, Mike Ball on guitar, Carlos &quot;Egie&quot; Egert on drums, and Mike Dunnigan on bass. After the recording of their first demo, Carlos Egert left the band and was replaced by Dunnigan's brother, Sean. Muir, at the time a student at Santa Monica College, originally only intended Suicidal Tendencies as a &quot;party band&quot;, but as they grew in notoriety he soon found the band at the center of his life. Suicidal Tendencies had a rough start including being voted &quot;Worst Band/Biggest Assholes&quot; in Flipside in 1982 but the following year were voted &quot;Best New Band&quot;. There were many rumors of the band members as well as their friends and followers being involved with gangs (especially the Venice White Boyz), with Muir's trademark blue bandanna and violence at the band's performances as evidence. In their original lineup photo, which can be seen inside their self-titled debut album, drummer Amery Smith is wearing a flipped up hat and under the bill are the markings &quot;V13&quot;, which are initials for the gang Venice 13. Though there were probably a handful of V13 members who also became ST fans, Amery was not a member of V13 but bassist Louiche Mayorga's brother Steve Mayorga was (and that's whose hat he's wearing for the photo). Eventually an entire gang sprung up around the group, the Suicidal Cycos (also known as the Suicidals, Suis or Suicidal Boyz) with chapters in Venice, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Orange County, Oceanside, San Diego and even a chapter in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n\nAll this controversy helped the band gain label attention, and in 1983 Suicidal signed with the independent label Frontier Records and released their self-titled debut. It was described by critic Steve Huey as &quot;Fast, furious, and funny... Mike Muir proves himself an articulate lyricist and commentator, delving into subjects like alienation, depression, and nonconformist politics with intelligence and humor.&quot; It contained the song &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, which featured a music video that became one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial MTV airplay, and greatly expanded the band's fan base. The song was featured in the 1984 film Repo Man, as well as in a 1986 episode of the TV show Miami Vice (Free Verse, which also featured a cameo appearance of the group performing in a new wave/punk club) and in the 2008 film Iron Man, where the song plays in the background as Tony Stark works on his car. Soon after the release of their debut album in 1983, Estes left the band and was replaced by Jon Nelson, former manager of the Venice-based band Neighborhood Watch. Nelson played with Suicidal on all the early punk shows from 1983 to 1984 contributing the music for future songs like: &quot;War Inside My Head&quot;,Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Got, I WantÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, &quot;Human Guinea Pig&quot;, &quot;You Are Forgiven&quot; and Look Up...(The Boy's Are Back), the latter ending up on the bands compilation record Welcome to Venice Though Nelson never appeared on any of the Suicidal releases, there are some live recordings of the song &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; as well as others. All the music written by Jon Nelson was purchased by Muir upon his departure from the band for a small amount of money and a Flying V guitar. He is credited on the albums only as written by (Suicidal Tendencies) and in 1987 was erroneously listed as guitarist on the reissue of their debut album &quot;Suicidal Tendencies&quot; which was soon corrected to appropriately credit Grant Estes.\n\nThat same year was the beginning of SuicidalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four-year recording hiatus and Mike Muir and bassist Louiche Mayorga formed the Label Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suicidal RecordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as the band Los Cycos Jon Nelson left the group and Suicidal Tendencies were banned from playing L.A. shows from an Incident at Perkins Palace (their fans tore out ten rows of seats and promoters couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the proper insurance to hire them) Muir was also about to try his hand at producing as well as starting the new label. Los Cycos was originally Mike Muir (Vocals), Bob Heathcote (bass), Anthony Gallo (Guitars) and Amery Smith (drums). After a few rehearsals Amery Smith left the line up to join Jon Nelson in starting their own band (The Brood). Los Cycos eventually included Grant Estes on lead guitar and original choices Bob Heathcote and Amery Smith were replaced by Louiche Mayorga (bass) and Sal Troy (drums). They recorded the song &quot;It's Not Easy&quot; written by Muir. &quot;Welcome to Venice&quot; was the first record to be released on Suicidal Records, unfortunately the original masters were destroyed in a fire. In 1989 Suicidal Tendencies re-recorded &quot;It's Not Easy&quot; for their 1989 release &quot;Controlled By Hatred/Feel Like Shit... DejaVu&quot; album. The other Los Cycos track &quot;A Little Each Day&quot; which never made it to the album, was re-recorded for the 1987 Suicidal Tendencies release &quot;Join the Army&quot; and again on &quot;Still Cyco After All These Years&quot; released in 93. In 2000 it resurfaced on the FNG compilation and a fourth time on 2008s (split) album Lights...Camera...Revolution!/Still Cyco After All These Years. Suicidal Tendencies played on the track Look Up...(The Boys are Back) which was the introduction of guitarist Rocky George and drummer RJ Herrera. The band finally found a new label in Caroline Records in 1986.\n\n\nFirst Comeback (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1988)\n\nWith the line-up of Muir, Louiche Mayorga, George, and Herrera, the band released their second album, Join the Army, in 1987 (see 1987 in music). The album was met with a mixed reaction from long-time fans due to its considerably more metal-oriented sound (an element brought to the table by Rocky George), as they were expecting another punk album. Nonetheless, Join the Army featured classic tracks such as &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; and &quot;Possessed to Skate&quot; (which featured a video, originally intended for an unsuccessful skateboard movie, which featured Timothy Leary).\n\n\nSecond Comeback (1997Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001)\n\nTo the excitement of many, Suicidal Tendencies returned in 1997. However, Rocky George, Robert Trujillo, and Jimmy DeGrasso were all unable to rejoin as they were busy with other projects. Muir and Clark brought in new lead guitarist Dean Pleasants (formerly of Infectious Grooves), new bassist Josh Paul and new drummer Brooks Wackerman (formerly of Bad4Good and Infectious Grooves, now with Bad Religion) to replace them.\n\nThe band released their first new material in almost half a decade, the Six the Hard Way EP in 1998, which also included two live tracks. Released on Suicidal Records, this EP saw the band switching back to their original punk metal and skatepunk style (with songs originally recorded by Cyco Miko covered). This, along with the absence of George and Trujillo, upset many of the bands metal-era fans, but fans of the older punk Suicidal warmly welcomed the new style.\nThird Hiatus &amp; Recent History (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nPaul and Wackerman (who had just joined Bad Religion) had left Suicidal Tendencies by 2002, while the band was on a temporary hiatus, and were replaced by brothers Steve and Ron Bruner on bass and drums, respectively. The band toured during 2003, but were forced take another hiatus in 2004 due to Mike Muir requiring surgery for a back injury.\n\nWhile the band failed to release an album with material, independently or otherwise, Suicidal Tendencies have continued to tour consistently since 2005. On October 29 of that year their live performance at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles was filmed. Suicidal Tendencies secured a spot in the metal/punk-rock Soundwave Festival in Australia in February and March 2007, taking in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth. They performed at the Artefact Festival in France on April 29, 2007, and performed in Istanbul, Turkey on May 29. They also headlined the Tuborg Stage at the Download Festival, held at Donington Park, UK.\nSuicidal Tendencies released 13, their first album with all-new material in 13 years, on March 26, 2013.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, Thomas Pridgen (former drummer of The Mars Volta) confirmed on his Instagram and Facebook page that he has joined Suicidal Tendencies.\n\nOn August 27, 2014, Suicidal Tendencies announced that bassist Tim Williams had passed away.\nCurrent Line-up:\n\n\n  - Mike Muir: Vocals (1981-present)\n\n  - Dean Pleasants: Guitars (1997-present)\n\n  - Nico Santora: Guitars (2012-present)\n\n  - Thomas Pridgen: Drums (2014-present)\n\n\n\nThis Discography Includes:\n\n\n  - Suicidal Tendencies (1983)\n\n  - Join The Army (1987)\n\n  - How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988)\n\n  - Controlled By Hatred - Feel Like Shit...Deja-Vu (1989)\n\n  - Lights...
