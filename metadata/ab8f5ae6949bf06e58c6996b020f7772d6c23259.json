The Master Mind Principle: two or more persons working together in complete harmony toward a mutual goal or goals...Napoleon Hill's philosophy teaches you what you were never taught. Specifically: How to Recognize, Relate, Assimilate and Apply principles whereby you can achieve any goal whatsoever that doesn't violate Universal Law - the Law of God and the rights of your fellowman...\n\n--W. Clement Stone Chairman, Combined International Corporation President, The Napoleon Hill Foundation\n\nDuring the past twenty-five years I have been blessed with more good fortune than any individual deserves but I shudder to think where I'd be today, or what I'd be doing if I had not been exposed to Napoleon Hill's philosophy. It changed my life.\n\n--Og Mandino, Author and Lecturer\n\nI knew Napoleon Hill in 1922 when I was a student in Salem College in the town of my birth. Mr. Hill came to our campus as the commencement speaker in that year. As I listened to him, I heard something other than just the words he spoke, I felt the substance - the wisdom - and the spirit of a man and his philosophy. Mr. Hill said &quot;the most powerful instrument we have in our hand is the power of our mind.&quot; Napoleon Hill compiled this philosophy of American achievement for the benefit of all people. I strongly commend this philosophy to you for achievement and service in your chosen field.\n\n--Senator Jennings Randolph West Virginia\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Author:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBorn into poverty in 1883, Napoleon Hill rose to become one of the world s most distinguished and respected authors.
