Next, they find where water is abundant and where it's scarce.\n\n\nEpisode 2: Mountains\nMountains are the most prominent products of the immense forces which shape \nthe living planet: tectonic drift, volcanic activity and erosion by wind, water, \nfrost and precipitation. We see how wildlife adapts to the harsh, often extreme \nconditions in various types of mountain ranges, such as Gelada baboons on a \nsuddenly volcano-pushed Ethiopian peek, pumas in the Andes, grizzly bears in \nthe Rockies, snow leopards in the Himalaya.\n\n\nEpisode 3: Fresh Water\nAlthough merely 3% of water on earth, fresh water plays an important part in \nthe planet's weather and erosion. It is immensely important for all non-marine \nwildlife, which drinks fresh water and swims, procreates, hunts in it. \nIts concentrations, such as rivers, lakes and swamps, abound in aquatic \nand other species, often adapted to 'wet' life.\n\n\nEpisode 4: Caves\nThe Earth's large, deep calcareous caves are virtually inaccessible and \ntherefore barely explored - requiring expert diving where flooded. \nSome of its wildlife is as strange and specific as in the deep, \ndarkest part of the ocean, whether physically adapted -notably to the dark. \nNevertheless, some caves(did) play an important part in native cultures, \neven as sources of fresh water for some Mayan cities.\n\n\nEpisode 5: Deserts\nA large and growing part of earth's land mass is covered in desert - \neach one widely varied in composition and dryness. \nWildlife species have adapted in different ways to these different \narid lands especially to get and conserve water. \nSome are physically desert-models, like camels, others just changed \ntheir diet and behavior. Most live mainly at night, when it's cooler. \nThe largest desert is northern Africa's Sahara, US size and extremely sandy, \nthe result of grinding erosion of mountains. Short moist moments or \nperiods are taken intense advantage off, \nleading to such extravaganzas as the locust swarm.\n\n\nEpisode 6: Ice Worlds\nThe polar caps have the most extreme seasonal contrasts, \ngrowing and melting vast ice masses, so wildlife adapts by annual migrations. \nThe majority of Antartica is a vast barren permafrost. \nOnly 3% of the coast and peninsular peaks are where life migrates \nto in the spring, for a short fertile summer, attracted by rich supplies \nof krill and fish. Only the Emperor penguin males breed 4 months \nin winter 100 miles inland. The Arctic has a more complete fauna which \nmigrates back North from the continent. Here, the Polar bear is threatened \nbecause global warming defrosts its seal hunt platform ice too fast.\n\n\nEpisode 7: Great Plains\nA quarter of the earth's land mass, from arctic to tropical, \nare open plains consisting of lowland as well as highland plateaus. \nHere grows virtually indestructible, fast-growing grasses of all \nsizes that feed the planet's largest herbivore populations, \nthe preys to solitary and social carnivores. Spectacular elements \nof the seasonal cycle of life can include mass migrations, \nmonsoons, drought and great fires.\n\n\nEpisode 8: Jungles\nOn 3% of the Earth's surface, the rain forest is the habitat \nfor half our animal species, even 80% of insects. \nSo its wildlife is most competitive, like the birds of paradise's mating, \nand specialized with unique relationships of predation, parasitism etc. \nFor plants, the quest for light is key to stratification, paralleled \nby interacting animals eating fruits, leaves and other animals. \nEven the jungle cacophony is stratified. On the soil, \nrecycling specialist like fungi restart the cycle of life. \nIn Central Africa even herds of elephants specialize \nin following self-made forest paths.\n\n\nEpisode 9: Shallow Seas\nShallow seas cover only 8% of earth's surface, but contain the richest, \nmost varied maritime life: from plankton and coral (literally vital \nfor the very existence of reefs) to birds and from various invertebrates \nto mammals like seals, dolphins and whales and from sea snakes to \ncountless fish species. Their ecological interaction is greatly varied \nand complex, often with nearby land to, even with deserts.\n\n\nEpisode 10: Seasonal Forests\nTrees are earth's largest organisms and are also one of the planet's \noldest inhabitants. Seasonal forests (unlike tropical rain-forest) \nthe largest land habitats. A third of all trees grow in the endless \ntaiga of the Arctic north. Northern America has forests that include \nCalifornia's sequoia's, the earth's largest trees. There and elsewhere, \ntheir vast production of photosynthesis and shade presides over a \nseasonal cycle of life and involves countless plant and animal species.\n\n\nEpisode 11: Ocean Deep\nOpen ocean, a vast biotope covering two thirds of the planet, \nsome shallow, some as deep as the mountain ranges are high. \nThe ocean has an immense, precariously complex food chain, \nvarying from microscopic animals, like krill, to whales, \nwhich ironically feed mainly on the former. Most species swim or \nfloat in it, many coming up for air, while other dive in from \nland or air, often to feed, but also to procreate on the coast, \nwhere some species come to lay their eggs. \nEven the shore is covered with life, largely based on organic matter, \nsuch as corpses.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmmy Award winning, 11-episodes, 5-years in the making, \nthe most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC, \nand the first to be filmed in high definition. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795176/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795176/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Earth_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Earth_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mywy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mywy&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n         This BRRip plays very well with PSP and XBOX\n\t    \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/search/anoXmous/0/7/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/search/anoXmous/0/7/0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/search/anoXmous/0/9/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/search/anoXmous/0/9/0&lt;/a&gt;\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/search/anoXmous/0/99/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/search/anoXmous/0/99/0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/Zen_Bud/0/7/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/Zen_Bud/0/7/0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 _/      _/                                             \n    _/_/_/  _/_/_/      _/_/      _/  _/    _/_/_/  _/_/      _/_/    _/    _/    _/_/_/\n _/    _/  _/    _/  _/    _/      _/      _/    _/    _/  _/    _/  _/    _/  _/_/     \n_/    _/  _/    _/  _/    _/    _/  _/    _/    _/    _/  _/    _/  _/    _/      _/_/  \n _/_/_/  _/    _/    _/_/    _/      _/  _/    _/    _/    _/_/      _/_/_/  _/_/_/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
