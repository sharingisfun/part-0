Here And Now\n\n\n\nSource: 1989 2-CD Set\n\nThe Best of Luther Vandross - The Best of Love 320cbr (Big Papi) 1989 Epic R&amp;B\n\n\nBy Robert \nAlthough Luther was really more of an album artist in the eighties (and please note that each of his eighties are worth owning in their own right!), however, he did manage to rack up a very impressive amount of hits on Billboard's R&amp;B chart during this time. Although THE BEST OF LOVE understandably doesn't have the cohesion of Luther's proper eighties discs, it is an excellent introduction/summary of the man at his creative peak.\n\nThe hits included are &quot;Never Too Much&quot; (#33 Pop, #1 R&amp;B, #4 Dance), &quot;Bad Boy/Having A Party&quot; (#55 Pop, #3 R&amp;B), &quot;If This World Were Mine&quot; (#4 R&amp;B), &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot; (#17 R&amp;B), &quot;Superstar/Until You Come Back To Me&quot; (#4 R&amp;B), &quot;Til My Baby Comes Home&quot; (#29 Pop, #4 R&amp;B), &quot;Give Me The Reason&quot; (#57 Pop, #3 R&amp;B), &quot;Stop To Love&quot; (#15 Pop, #1 R&amp;B, #7 Adult Contemporary), &quot;There's Nothing Better Than Love&quot; (#50 Pop, #1 R&amp;B, #20 Adult Contemporary), &quot;I Really Didn't Mean It&quot; (#6 R&amp;B), and &quot;Any Love&quot; (#44 Pop, #1 R&amp;B, #12 Adult Contemporary).\n\nThere are a few great lower-charting singles included, &quot;Promise Me&quot; (#72 R&amp;B), &quot;If Only For One Night/Creepin'&quot; (#59 R&amp;B), and &quot;So Amazing&quot; (#94 R&amp;B). Also of note is the inclusion of the two singles that Luther recorded with the group Change, the anthem &quot;Searching&quot; and the often-sampled &quot;Glow of Love,&quot; which is what led to Luther landing his solo recording contract with Columbia. There are also two non-single covers, &quot;A House Is Not A Home&quot; and &quot;Love Won't Let Me Wait,&quot; that nonetheless became classics in their own right.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are some singles that are missing from the set, and a few of them were actually significant hits. Charting singles that are absent include &quot;Don't You Know That&quot; (#10 R&amp;B), &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; (#72 R&amp;B), &quot;How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye&quot; (#27 Pop, #7 R&amp;B, #4 Adult Contemporary), &quot;I Let You Slide&quot; (#9 R&amp;B), &quot;It's Over Now&quot; (#4 R&amp;B), &quot;Wait For Love&quot; (#11 R&amp;B), &quot;She Won't Talk To Me&quot; (#30 Pop, #3 R&amp;B, #17 Adult Contemporary), and &quot;For You To Love&quot; (#3 R&amp;B). While all of the missing songs are also very good, the rest of the material is so terrific that their absence will not be noticeable while listening to this album. Although I would like to see this set remastered with a few of the above tracks re-inserted as bonus tracks.\n\nThere are also two then-newly recorded tracks as well. As most people know, it was first of these, the gorgeous &quot;Here and Now&quot; (#6 Pop, #1 R&amp;B, #3 Adult Contemporary), that proved to be Luther's first major introduction to mainstream audiences. The other song, &quot;Treat You Right&quot; (#5 R&amp;B), isn't as well known, but is almost as good. The two new hits helped send THE BEST OF LOVE to #26 on the Hot 200, and it reached the impressive Triple-Platinum status in sales.",
