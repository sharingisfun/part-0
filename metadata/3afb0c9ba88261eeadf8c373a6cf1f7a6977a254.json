  "description": "Statistics from A to Z - Confusing Concepts Clarified (2016) (Pdf) Gooner\r\n\r\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell (18 Nov. 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1119272033\r\nISBN-13: 978-1119272038\r\n\r\nStatistics is confusing, even for smart, technically competent people. And many students and professionals find that existing books and web resources don t give them an intuitive understanding of confusing statistical concepts. That is why this book is needed. Some of the unique qualities of this book are:\r\n\r\nEasy to Understand: Uses unique graphics that teach such as concept flow diagrams, compareâ€“andâ€“contrast tables, and even cartoons to enhance rememberability.\r\n\r\nEasy to Use: Alphabetically arranged, like a miniâ€“encyclopedia, for easy lookup on the job, while studying, or during an openâ€“book exam.\r\n\r\nWider Scope: Covers Statistics I and Statistics II and Six Sigma Black Belt, adding such topics as control charts and statistical process control, process capability analysis, and design of experiments. As a result, this book will be useful for business professionals and industrial engineers in addition to students and professionals in the social and physical sciences.\r\n\r\nIn addition, each of the 60+ concepts is covered in one or more articles. The 75 articles in the book are usually 5 7 pages long, ensuring that things are presented in biteâ€“sized chunks. The first page of each article typically lists five Keys to Understanding which tell the reader everything they need to know on one page. This book also contains an article on Which Statistical Tool to Use to Solve Some Common Problems , additional Which to Use When articles on Control Charts, Distributions, and Charts/Graphs/Plots, as well as articles explaining how different concepts work together (e.g., how Alpha, p, Critical Value, and Test Statistic interrelate)",
