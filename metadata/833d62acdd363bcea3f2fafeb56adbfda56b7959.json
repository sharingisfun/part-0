  "description": "Adobe After Effects CC 2015 v13.5 + Crack\n\nAdobe After Effects CC software is the industry-leading solution for creating sophisticated motion graphics and cinematic visual effects. Transform moving images for delivery to theaters, living rooms, personal computers, and mobile devices.A live 3D pipeline with Cinema 4D means you can import 3D objects and use them in 3D scenes in After Effects. No re-rendering. No waiting. Just more creating.\n\nKeying effects\nPreserve fine detail when keying compressed or poorly shot blue-screen or green-screen footage. Use the Advanced Spill Suppressor to control the amount of green spill left in green-screen footage.\n\nLive Text Templates for Premiere Pro\nPackage your After Effects compositions as Live Text templates so Premiere Pro editors can change the text without changing the text color, motion, or lower-third background.\n\nFlexible masking options and Premiere Pro Interchange\nUse masks to apply effects to specific areas of your compositions Ã¢â‚¬â€ no need for additional adjustment or track matte layers Ã¢â‚¬â€ and blend each effect individually into the original layer.
