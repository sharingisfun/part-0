  "description": "**** Please seed!!! There is no good torrents for v2.5 ****\n\nPlease respect the copyright owners, only download this fan edit if you own the original movie.\n\nAll credit goes to Harmy for this fan edit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Harmys-STAR-WARS-Despecialized-Edition-HD-V25-MKV-IS-OUT-NOW/topic/12713/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Harmys-STAR-WARS-Despecialized-Edition-HD-V25-MKV-IS-OUT-NOW/topic/12713/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a reconstruction of the 1977 theatrical version of STAR WARS. The original shots were painstakingly restored using \nvarious sources and the film received an extensive shot by shot colour correction based on a fade free 1977\nI.B. Technicolor Print.\n\nThe remastered version (v2.0) represented a significant improvement in picture quality over the earlier version.\n\nVersion v2.1 further improved upon the previous version mainly by refining the colour correction but also by replacing many of the despecialized shots with higher quality ones.\n\nVersion v2.5 offers few more little tweaks to the picture and contains an unprecedented number of audio options, including lossless \nDTS-HD tracks for the original mixes (the original 70mm six-track was recreated by hairy_hen, the original stereo mix was captured\nfrom LaserDisc PCM and fixed up by hairy_hen and the original mono mix was restored by Belbucus from a VHS recording), an isolated\nscore, four different commentary tracks, dubbing tracks in ten different languages and dialects and a British commentary\nfor visually impaired.\n\n\nMore information can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Harmys-STAR-WARS-Despecialized-Edition-HD/topic/12713/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Harmys-STAR-WARS-Despecialized-Edition-HD/topic/12713/&lt;/a&gt;",
