  "description": "Matt Dillon's first movie.  1979.\n\nDrugs, vandalism, and rock and roll.  All in Middle School. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0079688/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0079688/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNew Grenada is a planned community set in the desert where there is nothing for the kids to do, save for a rec center - which closes at 6 PM. The parents, in their zeal to attract industry to their town, have all but neglected their children. As a result, the kids begin to create their own entertainment, which involves vandalism, theft, and general hooliganism. During an incident when one of the kids brandishes an unloaded gun at town cop Ed Doberman, he is shot and killed. When the parents gather the next night to discuss the killing and the level of lawlessness among the youth, they soon find out that their kids have had all they can take.\n\nLots of music by cheap trick.  Some cars, Van Halen, etc.\n\nIMDB 7.6 out of 10 stars.\n\nXvid at a decent resolution.\n",
