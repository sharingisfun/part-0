The apparent patron saint here, though, is Marc Bolan: The slinky Ã¢â‚¬Å“Way She MovesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a T-Rex flair, and the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only cover is that bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“20th Century Boy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Missteps like Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParachuteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the too-screechy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Youth QuakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (which at this point could be renamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Middle-Aged QuakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) are rare, and Weiland, who credits his new wife as Ã¢â‚¬Å“inspiration and muse,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is obviously recharged. If this derivative album shows that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not reinventing the wheel, at least the wheel is still rolling. \n\nTrack listing\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Modzilla&quot;   \t3:17\n2. \t&quot;Way She Moves&quot;   \t4:11\n3. \t&quot;Hotel Rio&quot;   \t4:36\n4. \t&quot;Amethyst&quot;   \t4:17\n5. \t&quot;White Lightning&quot;   \t3:22\n6. \t&quot;Blue Eyes&quot;   \t3:57\n7. \t&quot;Bleed Out&quot;   \t2:45\n8. \t&quot;Youth Quake&quot;   \t3:46\n9. \t&quot;Beach Pop&quot;   \t3:30\n10. \t&quot;Parachute&quot;   \t4:29\n11. \t&quot;20th Century Boy&quot;   \t4:20\n12. \t&quot;Circles&quot;   \t3:16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d886b2d319d9fe3f3cae1139629bbec06cb54a06","amp;dn":"Scott+Weiland+And+The+Wildabouts+-+Blaster+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d886b2d319d9fe3f3cae1139629bbec06cb54a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,134,178,211,25,217,254,63,60,174,17,57,98,155,190,192,108,181,74,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
