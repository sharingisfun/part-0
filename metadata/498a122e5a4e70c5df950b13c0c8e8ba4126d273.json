Beloved by Gwyneth Paltrow (Ã¢â‚¬Å“This might be my favorite thing everÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and named SaveurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best New Food blog of 2013Ã¢â‚¬â€with half a million Facebook fans and countingÃ¢â‚¬â€Thug Kitchen wants to show everyone how to take charge of their plates and cook up some real f*cking food.\n\nYeah, plenty of blogs and cookbooks preach about how to eat more kale, why ginger fights inflammation, and how to cook with microgreens and nettles. But they are dull or pretentious as hellÃ¢â‚¬â€and most people canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford the hype.\n\nThug Kitchen lives in the real world. In their first cookbook, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re throwing down more than 100 recipes for their best-loved meals, snacks, and sides for beginning cooks to home chefs. \n\nReview\n\n&quot;Dear reader, I love Thug Kitchen's cooking. As hilariously foul-mouthed as these motherf*ckers are, I really like their passion for eating the right food, for cutting to the chase, and for knocking up good, nutritious food from scratch. Their message is simpleÃ¢â‚¬â€stop relying on the microwave, stop relying on processed crap. Whoever you are and wherever you are, get down to the markets and supermarkets, use your budget to pick up some fresh ingredients, and get cooking. So, Thug Kitchen, good luck, and keep doing what you're doing.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Jamie Oliver","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:498a122e5a4e70c5df950b13c0c8e8ba4126d273","amp;dn":"Thug+Kitchen%2C+Eat+Like+You+Give+a+F_ck+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"498a122e5a4e70c5df950b13c0c8e8ba4126d273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,138,18,46,90,78,112,197,223,149,11,19,192,200,232,186,65,38,210,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
