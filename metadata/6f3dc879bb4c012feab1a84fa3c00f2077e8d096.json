  "description": "About This Game\r\nâ€œThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.â€ â€“ H.P. Lovecraft\r\n\r\nThe year is 2046 and mankindâ€™s discovery of near-lightspeed &quot;fold engine&quot; propulsion has empowered mankind's Osiris expeditionary missions to the Gliese 581 system. You are the second colonization team sent by the U.N.E. (United Nations of Earth) to study potential habitable planets when your spacecraft malfunctions braking from light speed, forcing an emergency landing on the planetâ€™s surface.\r\n\r\nOvercome the dangers of an environment with unpredictable weather conditions by building a central base, expanding the structure further with modular units to grow food, create research centers, manufacturing bays and more. To further advance technologies and thrive on the planet, traverse into a world filled equally with breathtaking landscapes and alien terrors that will freeze your blood. Osiris is a beautiful game that uniquely combines inventive crafting, curious exploration, and skillful combat. Explore an alien system and colonize worlds of incredible wonders and unforgiving dangers",
