  "description": "\nPublisher: St. Martin's Griffin (June 7, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1250067162\r\nISBN-13: 978-1250067166\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a recent survey, over 22 million Americans identified their eating habits as &quot;vegetarian-inclined.&quot; They haven't given up meat, but understand that we need to rethink the way we plan meals. These millions of people are always on the hunt for new, creative ways to work more of them into their diets. Food Network star Nikki Dinki is here to fill this need. She's not a vegetarian; she's not a vegan; Nikki is simply a great chef and healthy eater who plans her meals with the meat on the side!\r\n\r\nInside are no fewer than 100 recipes to put meat in the passenger seat. You won't miss the beef in these Eggplant Meatballs; you'll marvel that pasta can be made from a parsnip using just a peeler; and you'll never want traditional nachos again after trying Nikki's Cabbage Nachos.\r\n\r\nMeat on the Side is for home cooks looking to make the shift to healthier, vegetable-focused meals; couples where one person is vegetarian and the other is not; vegetarians looking for new ways to eat vegetables; and for the family that wants unique recipes that are guaranteed to get their children to eat healthier",
