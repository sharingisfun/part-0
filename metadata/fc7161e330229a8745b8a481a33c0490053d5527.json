A visit from his only living relative reveals the truth. Nick has inherited the ability to see supernatural creatures, and as a &quot;Grimm,&quot; he is tasked with keeping the balance between mankind and the mythological. A reformed &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; becomes his greatest (and also reluctant) ally and confidant. It's not long before his work as a policeman leads Nick to the criminals he once thought were only found in fairy tales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/nFE1OZq.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/PZMxiLA.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/rZTOusk.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/XNFb7rt.jpg\r\n\r\n###SUBS ARE MUXED WITHIN THE FILES###\r\n(YOU CAN ENABLE or DISABLE AS PER YOUR REQUIREMENT)\r\n\r\n\r\n***PLEASE SEED BACK FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN***\r\n\r\nUSE THE LATEST VERSION OF K-LITE OR CCCP FOR THE BEST PLAYBACK\r\n(WANNA STICK WITH VLC?
