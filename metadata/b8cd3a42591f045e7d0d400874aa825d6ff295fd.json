If it is dirty, take a lint free \n\t\tnon-abrasive cloth and wipe gently to clean it (always wipe \n\t\tfrom the inside of the CD to the outside edges).  If the \n\t\tdata side of the CD appears to be scratched, return the \n\t\tgame to the store that you bought it from, and exchange it \n\t\tfor a new copy. If you are unable to exchange the game at \n\t\tthe store that you bought it from, please call Customer \n\t\tSupport for information on our exchange policy.\n\nProblem:\tThe computer freezes during install, or you receive an \n\t\terror message (such as &quot;*_ins error&quot; or &quot;An error has \n\t\toccurred during the move data process&quot;) during install.\nAnswers: \t1. Your computer may be using an older 16-bit CD-ROM \n\t\tdriver \n\t\t2. There may not be enough space on your hard drive for \n\t\ttemporary files to expand and/or you need to free up \n\t\tresources\n\t\t3. The CD-ROM drive might be having problems with how it \n\t\tbuffers information. \n\t\t4. The Autorun or DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive could \n\t\tbe interfering with the game installation.\n\nTo check and see if your computer is using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver:\n - Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.\n - Click on the 'Performance' tab.\n - In the Performance status box, if the File System line says  &quot;Some \n   drivers are using MS-DOSÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® compatibility&quot;, you are using a 16-bit \n   CD-ROM driver.  If you are using 16-bit CD-ROM drivers: Contact the \n   manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive or the manufacturer of your \n   computer for an updated 32-bit CD-ROM driver.\n\nTo free up Resources:\n - Close all unnecessary programs running in the Background.  \n - Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time to open the Close \n   Program window, select a program, and press the 'End Task' button.  \n   Repeat this process until all programs except 'Explorer' and 'Systray' \n   are closed.  Win98 users can click on the 'Start' button, then the \n   &quot;Run...&quot; option.  At the command line type msconfig.  Click on the \n   startup tab and you can shut off all starting programs except systray \n   and explorer from there, too.\n - Keep at least 100MB free on the hard drive that the game is installed \n   to, or twice your RAM, whichever is larger.\n - Delete all files in your C:WindowsTemp folder, then empty the \n   Recycle Bin.\n - If you have Norton Utilities(TM) empty the Norton Wastebasket as \n   well.\n - Run ScanDisk\n - Defrag your hard drive\n\nTurn off read-ahead on the CD-ROM drive:\n - Right-click on the `My Computer' icon and select `Properties'.\n - Click on the `Performance' tab.\n - Click on the `File System' button.\n - Choose the `CD-ROM' tab at the top\n - Change the `Optimize access pattern for' field to `No read-ahead'\n - Click on 'Apply', then 'OK' and finally click 'Close' (you will be \n   prompted to restart your system).\n\nTurn off the Autorun and DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive:\n - Right click on the 'My Computer' icon and choose 'Properties'.\n - Click on the 'Device Manager' tab.\n - Click on the '+' sign next to the CD-ROM line so that it becomes \n   a '-' sign.\n - Click on the line that appears under the CD-ROM line so that it \n   is highlighted, then click on the 'Properties' button.\n - Click on the 'Settings' tab.\n - Look for the Auto-insert Notification and DMA lines.  If there \n   is a check mark in the boxes next to either of these lines, click \n   on the box to remove the check mark.\n - Click on the 'Apply' button, and then click on the 'OK' button.\n - When you are asked if you want to restart your system, choose \n   'Yes'. \n\nNOTE:  You can restore all of the CD-ROM settings back to normal \n       after the game has been successfully installed.\n\n\nLaunching the Game I\n\nProblem:   \tAfter launching the game from the Start menu or \n     \t \tDesktop icon, you get a blank screen, a black box \n\t\tthat surrounds the mouse cursor, blurring or choppy \n\t\tgraphics, vertical lines on the screen, choppy sound, \n\t\tor no sound.\nAnswer: \tThere is probably a conflict between your video or \n\t\tsound card and Microsoft's DirectX.\nSolution: \t(see below)\n\nFor Windows 95 and 98 users: \n - Press the 'Start' button on the Windows 95/98-task bar and select \n   'Run...'. \n - Type &quot;dxdiag&quot; then click on the 'OK' button. This will run the \n   DirectX Diagnostics Tool.\n - Make sure all your files are DirectX compatible. Select the \n   'DirectX Files' tab make sure there are no exclamation points \n   next to the file names.  If you find exclamation points under \n   this tab you will need to reinstall DirectX by going to the \n   'START' Button on the Windows95 task bar then select 'Run...' and \n   type your CD-ROM drive letter followed by &quot;:DirectXdxsetup.exe&quot; \n   and click on the 'Reinstall DirectX' button. This will reinstall \n   DirectX.\n - Make sure all of your drivers are DirectX compatible.  Select the \n   'DirectX Drivers' tab and make sure there are no exclamation \n   points next to any of the file names.  If you find exclamation \n   points under this tab you will need to update your drivers by \n   contacting the manufacturer of the hardware through their Phone \n   Support or through their web site. 3DO has a listing of \n   manufactures sites available.  Simply go to: \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.3do.com/support.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.3do.com/support.&lt;/a&gt;  \n   When you see the text that says &quot;Choose your platform&quot; click on \n   the PC Games link, click the Troubleshooting link on the left \n   side from the pull down menu and then click the 'Go' button.  \n   You will find the driver links at the bottom of the DirectX and \n   Drivers page.  Test your hardware with the DirectX Diagnostics \n   tool.  Run the tests that are available on the 'Display', \n   'Sound', and 'Input' tabs.  If one or more tests fail, this \n   could be due to driver incompatibility. Installing the newest \n   drivers available for your sound and video card hardware can \n   usually resolve this.\n\nFor Windows 98 users:\n - Press the 'Start' button on the Windows 98 task bar and select \n   'Help'.  Select the 'Search' tab, type `DirectX Troubleshooter' \n   in the text box, and then press the 'List Topics' button.  Select \n   'DirectX Troubleshooter' in the Topics window, click the 'Display \n   Button', and then follow the instructions to troubleshoot your \n   DirectX issue.\n\nNOTE:  The DirectX Diagnostic tool may not recognize if your current \n       drivers are too old for the current version of DirectX that \n       the game uses.  All 3DO games ship with the most current \n       version of DirectX that is available at the time the game is \n       produced.  If you've just bought a game that installs a newer \n       version of DirectX over your old version, a good rule of \n       thumb is to update your sound and video drivers.  If this is \n       a version of DirectX that has just been released by Microsoft, \n       it is possible that the manufacturer of your sound and video \n       cards may not have drivers that will support it yet.  If you \n       have an older video card, the manufacturer may have stopped \n       producing new drivers for it altogether.  If the manufacturer \n       has stopped supporting your cards drivers you will need to \n       purchase and install cards that will support the new version \n       of DirectX.\n\n\nLaunching the Game II\n\nProblem:\tYou try to start the game and the screen flashes \n\t\tbriefly, and you are returned to the desktop without \n\t\tan error message. \nAnswer:\t\tThere are probably miscellaneous programs running in \n\t\tthe background that are interfering with the game and \n\t\tcausing it to crash. \nSolution:\t(see below)\n\nFor Windows 95 users:     \n - Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time to open the Close \n   Program window.\n - Click on a program so that it is highlighted, then click on the \n   'End Task' button.\n - Repeat this process until only 'Explorer' and 'Systray' are left \n   in the Close Program list, then try running the game.\n\nFor Windows 98 users:\n - Click on the Windows 'Start' button, then choose 'Run...'.\n - In the Run line type in: &quot;msconfig&quot;, then push the 'Enter' key. \n   (This will bring up the System Configuration Utility.)\n - Select the 'Startup' tab, and turn all of the check boxes off, \n   except for the one next to 'Systray'.\n - Press 'OK'. When you are prompted to restart your system, click \n   'Yes'.\n - Once your machine has restarted try running the program again. \n\nOther\n\nProblem:\n\tLarge, XL and 3D Mouse cursor doesn't refresh correctly in \n\twindowed mode.\nAnswer:\n\tSwitching to a standard, non-animated mouse cursor will \n  \tcorrect this problem.\nSolution:\nFor Windows 95 and 98 users:\n1. Click on the Windows Start button, then choose settings, then \n   control panel.\n2. Double-click on the mouse icon to open the mouse properties \n   control applet.\n3. Click on the pointers tab.\n4. With the &quot;Normal Select&quot; cursor selected, click &quot;browse&quot; near \n   the bottom of the window.\n5. Double-click on a non-animated cursor from the list of cursors \n   in the windows. (i.e. Arrow_m.cur).\n6. Click 'OK' to save your changes.\n\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\nIf you are experiencing video trouble, difficulties launching the \ngame, or getting kicked-back to the desktop, you may need to make \nsome changes to the Display Settings.  All of our newer games are \ndesigned to run in 16 bit High Color.  If you are running your \ndesktop at any other color resolution, there is a possibility that \nthe color palette will not automatically adjust to 16 bit High \nColor.  You will need to do this from the desktop.  \n\nTo adjust the Color Display Settings, please do the following:\nFor Windows 95 users: \n - Click on 'Start' in the Start Menu, next on 'Settings', then on\n   'Control Panel'. When the Control panel window comes up, \n   double-click on the 'Display' Icon and click on the 'Settings' \n   tab.\n\nTo adjust the Color Palette:  \n - Click on the down arrow at the end of the &quot;Colors&quot; field, select \n   the appropriate setting (in most cases 16 bit High Color) then \n   click on 'Apply' (located at the lower right area of window).  A \n   message may appear: &quot;Windows has adjusted your color display.  \n   Do you want to keep this setting?&quot;... select 'YES', then the 'OK' \n   button (Located at the lower left area of window).\n\nFor Windows 98 users: \n - The above steps are correct except 'Color Palette' is called \n   'Colors'.\n\nMost of our newer games are designed to run at a resolution of \n800x600.  If your monitor is not capable of switching to this \nresolution, the game will fail to launch.  To check to see what \nresolution your monitor is set to:\n\nFor Windows 95 and 98 users:\n - Right-click on an empty area on your desktop and choose \n   'Properties' from the menu that appears. \n - When your Display Properties comes up, go to the 'Settings' tab. \n   Make sure the Desktop Area (Win 95) / Screen Area (Win 98) is set \n   to 800x600 or higher. \n - If the slider is grayed out and cannot be changed, your monitor \n   may not be capable of running at this resolution.  There can be \n   two reasons for this. First, your monitor may be setup incorrectly \n   under Windows.  If Windows says that your monitor is a &quot;Standard \n   VGA 640x480&quot; or &quot;Unknown Monitor&quot;, you should go to your monitor \n   manufacturer's website and download the latest driver for your \n   monitor and install it.  If you have your monitor configured \n   correctly and it still can't run at 800x600 mode, then your \n   monitor may not be capable of running at that high of a resolution.  \n   You may want to consult the monitor's documentation or contact it's \n   manufacturer to confirm this.  If your monitor cannot switch to \n   800x600 resolution and the game requires this particular resolution \n   you will not be able to run the game on it.\n\nFor the Desktop Area adjustment:\n - Click to the left or right of the slider bar to the recommended \n   Desktop Settings then click on 'Apply' (Located at the lower right \n   area of window).  You will receive a message: Windows has now \n   resized your Desktop Area, keep these settings?, select 'YES', then \n   on the 'OK' (Located at the lower left area of the window).\n\nVideo and Sound card manufacturers regularly update their software \ndrivers to enhance performance and stability, and to improve \ncompatibility with DirectX.  You can find links to many of these \nmanufacturers' sites by going to the DirectX section of our support \nweb site, which is located at http://www.3do.com/support.  When you \nsee the text that says &quot;Choose your platform&quot; click on PC Games link \nbelow it, click the Troubleshooting link on the left side of the next \nscreen, click on the Basic Troubleshooting link, select DirectX and \nDrivers from the pull down menu, and then click the Go button.  You \nwill find the driver links at the bottom of the DirectX and Drivers \npage.\n\n - You may obtain a list of Microsoft-certified video and audio \n   drivers for your hardware by going to \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.microsoft.com/hcl/.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/hcl/.&lt;/a&gt;  \n   Drivers listed here are confirmed to be compatible with Windows 95 \n   and Windows 98. \n - Microsoft updates DirectX and its components regularly and posts \n   them for download off of their web site at \n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.microsoft.com/DirectX.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/DirectX.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWindows 2000 \n\nWindows 2000 is not necessarily intended for gaming purposes, as this \nquote from Microsoft's site would attest to:\n\n &quot;Make sure that Windows 2000 is appropriate for your needs.
