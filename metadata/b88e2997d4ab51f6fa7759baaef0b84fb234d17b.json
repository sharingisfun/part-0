Especially in large prints hung on a wall, the difference between Blow Up and Photoshop is astounding. Version 3 makes pictures even sharper without computer artifacts.\n\nIf you understand PhotoshopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resize command then you already know how to use Blow Up. Our large library of standard paper sizes makes it even easier. With Lightroom and CMYK support, Blow Up fits into a professional workflow.\n\nFeatures \n\nNew! Image Quality - In Blow Up 3 we found ways to make edges even sharper without introducing computery artifacts. The images below show the difference between Blow Up 3 and traditional bicubic enlargement used by Photoshop and other image editors. \n\nNew! Lightroom Support - Blow Up 3 has tight Lightroom integration that supports batch processing and does not require Photoshop. Visit our Lightroom page to learn the details.\n\nBlow Up Interface ShotNew! Simplicity - Blow UpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interface is deceptively simple. Just set your paper size as you would in Photoshop and optionally set a crop region. In version 3 we kept all the rocket science under the hood. Watch our short videos or try Blow Up yourself for free to see how easy it is.\n\nNew! Speed - Blow Up 3 runs faster on both Macintosh and Windows computers. \n\nHuge Images - You can resize up to 300,000 pixels per side, the maximum Photoshop can handle. Of course, Photoshop would choke on a square image that big, but if you are making a billboard that Photoshop can handle, so can Blow Up! \n\nCMYK - Blow Up can handle CMYK images used in offset printing and 16-bit/channel images used by professional photographers.\n\nPresets - Blow Up has presets for common paper sizes, including photo papers and standard US, European, and Japanese sizes. \n\nOutput Sharpening - Just choose your paper type and Blow Up sharpens the right amount to compensate for ink diffusion.\n\nSystem Requirements \n\nBlow Up 3 requires the following:\n- Intel Core 2 processor or compatible \n- Windows Vista or newer\n\nHost Requirements\n\nBlow Up 3 is a plug-in and requires one of the following host applications: \n- Adobe Photoshop CS4 or newer\n- Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 or newer \n- Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 or newer\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/blowup/index.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alienskin.com/blowup/index.aspx&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88e2997d4ab51f6fa7759baaef0b84fb234d17b","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Blow+Up+3.0.0.691++%2832+-+64+bit%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b88e2997d4ab51f6fa7759baaef0b84fb234d17b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,142,41,151,212,171,81,246,250,119,89,186,174,240,184,79,178,52,209,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
