  "description": "Italian Interiors\r\n2012 | 3034607520 | 256 pages | PDF | 101 MB\r\n\r\nItalian interior design has been distinguished for decades by its innovative power and cour- age, not only on an aesthetic level but also in its use of new materials and combinations thereof. Italian designers have shown a greater willingness to absorb influences from art and design, blurring the lines between those disciplines, sometimes provocatively, sometimes subtly one of the reasons why their trend-setting creations are in demand worldwide for interiors of restaurants and stores, private residences and hotels, offices and museums. The book presents a selection of the latest designs from 2000 to 2009, realized in Italy and other countries, including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Dubai. The architects and designers include established masters as Renzo Piano, Michele De Lucci, and Giorgio Armani but also representatives of the younger genera- tion. Among the volumes foremost features is the comprehensive project documentation with many technical drawings and detail photographs",
