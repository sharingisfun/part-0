It will be Faith No More's first studio album since 1997's Album of the Year, marking the longest gap between two studio albums in their career, and their first release on Reclamation Records. Sol Invictus will also be the band's first album since 1992's Angel Dust not to feature a lineup change from after one consecutive studio album. The album marks the group's fifth collaboration with longtime producer Matt Wallace, though it also happens to be the third album he did not produce, his involvement being reduced to helping with the final mix.\n\n\nIn a January 2013 interview, Mike Patton suggested that the band would not remain active beyond the reunion tour, stating that &quot;it's sort of petered out&quot; and the band was &quot;maybe a little too conscious for [their] own good.&quot; In July 2013 Billy Gould hinted the band may record new material in the future, saying &quot;We will do something again only when all members are with the focus on that, and ready for the challenge. This is not the time... yet.&quot; On May 29, 2014, Faith No More posted a message (along with a photograph of Mike Patton) on their Twitter account, saying that &quot;the reunion thing was fun, but now it's time to get a little creative.&quot; On July 4, Faith No More played their first show in two years at Hyde Park in London, supporting Black Sabbath\n\n&quot;Motherfucker&quot; was the first single to be released from Sol Invictus. It was released on November 28, 2014 exclusively on 7&quot; vinyl to coincide with Record Store Day's Black Friday. It was later released digitally on December 5, 2014. The &quot;Superhero&quot; single was initially scheduled to be released on March 17, 2015 on 7&quot; vinyl, but was delayed to March 23 after the pressing plants suffered from adverse weather effects.\n\nTrack listing\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tMusic \tLength \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Sol Invictus&quot;   \t  \t  \t2:37\n2. \t&quot;Superhero&quot;   \t  \t  \t5:15\n3. \t&quot;Sunny Side Up&quot;   \t  \t  \t2:59\n4. \t&quot;Separation Anxiety&quot;   \t  \t  \t3:44\n5. \t&quot;Cone of Shame&quot;   \t  \t  \t4:40\n6. \t&quot;Rise of the Fall&quot;   \t  \t  \t4:09\n7. \t&quot;Black Friday&quot;   \t  \t  \t3:19\n8. \t&quot;Motherfucker&quot;   \t  \t  \t3:33\n9. \t&quot;Matador&quot;   \t  \t  \t6:08\n10. \t&quot;From the Dead&quot;   \t  \t  \t3:06\n\nPersonnel\n\nFaith No More\n\n    Mike Bordin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Roddy Bottum Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, vocals\n    Billy Gould Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, producer, recording engineer\n    Jon Hudson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Mike Patton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n\nProduction\n\n    Matt Wallace Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mixing engineer\n    Maor Appelbaum Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering engineer\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
