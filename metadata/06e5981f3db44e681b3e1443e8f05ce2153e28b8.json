  "description": "Publisher: Rockport Publishers (April 1, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 159253676X\nISBN-13: 978-1592536764\n\nFor anyone trying to communicate in a new language, one has to first gain a complete understanding of its fundamentals; the ABCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of that languageÃ¢â‚¬â€definitions, functions, and usage. The Language of Graphic Design provides graphic design students and practitioners with an in-depth understanding of the fundamental elements and principles of their languageÃ¢â‚¬â€graphic designÃ¢â‚¬â€what they are, why they are important, and how to use them effectively. Organized by the building blocks of the graphic design language, this reference includes work by some of the most successful and renowned practitioners from around the world and how they have applied these fundamental principles to their work. By examining both student and professional work, this comprehensive handbook is a more meaningful, memorable, and inspiring reference tool for novice design students, as well as young designers starting their careers.\nTo understand visual communications one has to first understand by seeing. To develop this discipline or visual sense is similar to learning a new language with its own unique alphabet, lexicon (vocabulary), and syntax (sentence structure). This book provides clear, concise information that will enhance visual literacy, while using dynamic, memorable visual references to inspire and reinforce the skill of seeing.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard Poulin is cofounder, design director, and a principal of Poulin + Morris Inc. (http://www.poulinmorris.com), an internationally recognized, multidisciplinary design consultancy located in New York City. His work has been recognized by major design organizations, competitions, and publications including the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), Communication Arts, Graphis, Library of Congress, Type Director Club, and the New York Art Directors Club.
