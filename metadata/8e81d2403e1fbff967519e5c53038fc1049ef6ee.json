It seems amazing that his period of greatest activity was so short, not only because he recorded prolifically, but also because, taking advantage of his fame, the record companies that recorded him as a sideman in the 1950s frequently reissued those recordings under his name and there has been a wealth of posthumously released material as well. Since Coltrane was a protean player who changed his style radically over the course of his career, this has made for much confusion in his discography and in appreciations of his playing. There remains a critical divide between the adherents of his earlier, more conventional (if still highly imaginative) work and his later, more experimental work. No one, however, questions Coltrane's almost religious commitment to jazz or doubts his significance in the history of the music. \n\nJohn Coltrane is sometimes described as one of jazz's most influential musicians, but one is hard put to find followers who actually play in his style. Rather, he is influential by example, inspiring musicians to experiment, take chances, and devote themselves to their craft. The controversy about his work has never died down, but partially as a result, his name lives on and his recordings continue to remain available and to be reissued frequently.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Giant Steps\n02.Cousin Mary\n03.Naima\n04.Like Sonny\n05.My Shining Hour\n06.My Favorite Things\n07.Central Park West\n08.Summertime\n09.Mr. Syms\n10.Equinox\n11.Body And Soul\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e81d2403e1fbff967519e5c53038fc1049ef6ee","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282000%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e81d2403e1fbff967519e5c53038fc1049ef6ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,129,210,64,62,31,191,249,103,81,158,92,83,3,143,193,4,158,246,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
