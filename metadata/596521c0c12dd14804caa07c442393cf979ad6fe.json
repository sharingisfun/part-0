  "description": "Luther Vandross\nThe Ultimate Luther Vandross (2006)\n\n\n\nLuther Vandross was one of the most successful R&amp;B artists of the 1980s and '90s. Not only did he score a series of multi-million-selling albums containing chart-topping hit singles and perform sold-out tours of the U.S. and around the world, but he also took charge of his music creatively, writing or co-writing most of his songs and arranging and producing his records. He also performed these functions for other artists, providing them with hits as well. He was, however, equally well known for his distinctive interpretations of classic pop and R&amp;B songs, reflecting his knowledge and appreciation of the popular music of his youth.
