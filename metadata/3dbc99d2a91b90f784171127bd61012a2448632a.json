This release includes new releases of MATLAB and Simulink as well as updates and bug fixes to all other products.\r\n\r\nMillions of engineers and scientists worldwide use MATLAB to analyze and design the systems and products transforming our world. MATLAB is in automobile active safety systems, interplanetary spacecraft, health monitoring devices, smart power grids, and LTE cellular networks. It is used for machine learning, signal processing, image processing, computer vision, communications, computational finance, control design, robotics, and much more. \r\n\r\nWhat's New in MathWorks MATLAB R2016a\r\n\r\nDesktop\r\n- Live Editor: Create and run live scripts with embedded output; add equations and images to enhance the interactive narrative\r\n- Toolboxes: Programmatically package and install custom MATLAB toolboxes with matlab.addons.toolbox package\r\n- Tab Completion: Complete parameter names and options in select MATLAB function calls\r\n- Pause Button: Pause the execution of a program from the Editor and enter debug mode\r\n- Toolboxes: Customize additions to MATLAB path upon toolbox installation\r\n- Preferences: Migrate preferences from MATLAB versions up to three releases preceding the release starting up\r\n- verLessThan Function: Compares releases\r\n- Internationalization: Default encoding scheme on Mac platforms will change in a future release\r\nLanguage and Programming\r\n- datetime Object: Set the default locale and format of datetime objects through the Preference panel\r\n- zeros, ones, and eye Functions: Create logical arrays\r\n- cellstr, deblank, and strtrim Functions: Keep significant whitespace characters when removing leading or trailing whitespace\r\n- rowfun and varfun Functions: Create output table without row names when using the 'GroupingVariables' parameter\r\n- Debugging: Set breakpoints while MATLAB is executing\r\n- Functionality being removed or changed\r\nMathematics\r\n- Moving Statistics Functions: Calculate moving statistics using the movmean, movsum, movmedian, movmax, movmin, movvar, and movstd functions\r\n- datetime and duration Arrays: Compute standard deviations with std\r\n- datetime and duration Arrays: Ignore NaNs and NaTs using 'omitnan' or 'omitnat' in the functions mean, median, std, and sum\r\n- graph and digraph Classes: Analyze graphs and networks using centrality and nearest nodes functions\r\n- svds Function: Compute singular values with improved performance and convergence behavior with a wide variety of matrices\r\n- median Function: Compute medians with improved performance\r\n- cummin, cummax, cumprod, and cumsum Functions: Compute cumulative minimum, maximum, product, and sum with improved performance\r\n- GraphPlot Objects: Interactively inspect graph plots using data cursor and plot selection\r\nGraphics\r\n- polarplot Function: Plot data in polar coordinates and modify properties of polar axes\r\n- yyaxis Function: Create charts with two y-axes and customize each y-axis individually\r\n- Legend Object: Add legend title and create callbacks to highlight plots when clicking legend items\r\n- histogram2 Function: Enable data linking and brushing for bivariate histograms\r\n- Function Plots: Visualize mathematical expressions as parametric line, surface, and contour plots\r\n- Graphics Display: Render plots with large numbers of markers faster\r\n- 3-D Pan and Zoom: Explore data with improved pan and zoom behavior for axes in a 3-D view\r\n- Graphics Drivers: Use latest drivers to avoid instabilities with older NVIDIA Windows drivers\r\n- Printed Figure Size: Print or save figures that match size of the figure on the screen by default\r\n- print Function: Print figures that fill page using the '-fillpage' and '-bestfit' options\r\n- Figure Menu: Save figures that honor the PaperPosition value using File &gt; Save As\r\n- Functionality being removed or changed\r\nApp Building\r\n- App Designer: Build MATLAB apps with line and scatter plots using an enhanced design environment and an expanded UI component set\r\nData Import and Export\r\n- writetable Function: Write to text files significantly faster, especially for large files\r\n- readtable Function: Read from Excel files with faster performance\r\n- writetable Function: Write to Excel files on Mac and Linux platforms\r\n- spreadsheetDatastore Function: Import and process data from a collection of Excel files\r\n- datastore Function: Import a TabularTextDatastore object with improved file format detection\r\n- ImageDatastore Object: Specify image labels using the Labels property and process with splitEachLabel, countEachLabel, and shuffle functions\r\n- fileDatastore Function: Create a custom datastore for a file collection too large to fit in memory\r\n- readtable Function: Read text files with automatic detection of delimiters, header lines, and variable names\r\n- tabularTextDatastore and imageDatastore Functions: Create objects to import large text and image data collections\r\n- writetable Function: Detect text with embedded delimiters automatically and write as quoted text\r\n- TabularTextDatastore Objects: Read text files with automatic detection of delimiters, header lines, and variable names\r\n- imread Function: Generate C-code using MATLAB Coder\r\n- Functionality being removed or changed[/b]",
