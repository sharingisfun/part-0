  "description": "Think Like a Freak: The Authors of Freakonomics Offer to Retrain Your Brain\nAuthor: Steven D. Levitt &amp; Stephen J. Dubner\nPublished: 2014\nPublisher: William Morrow\nISBN: 9780062218360\nFormat: Retail Epub and Mobi\nReader Required:\nEpub- Adobe Digital Editions, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\nMobi- Kindle app, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\n\n\nThe New York Times bestselling Freakonomics changed the way we see the world, exposing the hidden side of just about everything. Then came SuperFreakonomics, a documentary film, \n\nan award-winning podcast, and more.\n\nNow, with Think Like a Freak, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have written their most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and \n\nunconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and teach us all to think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationallyÃ¢â‚¬â€to think, that is, like a \n\nFreak.\n\nLevitt and Dubner offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems, whether your interest lies in minor lifehacks or major global reforms. As always, no topic is \n\noff-limits. They range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn the secrets of a Japanese \n\nhot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re from Nigeria.\n\nSome of the steps toward thinking like a Freak:\n\nFirst, put away your moral compassÃ¢â‚¬â€because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to see a problem clearly if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already decided what to do about it.\nLearn to say Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t knowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€for until you can admit what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet know, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virtually impossible to learn what you need to.\nThink like a childÃ¢â‚¬â€because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come up with better ideas and ask better questions.\nTake a master class in incentivesÃ¢â‚¬â€because for better or worse, incentives rule our world.\nLearn to persuade people who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be persuadedÃ¢â‚¬â€because being right is rarely enough to carry the day.\nLearn to appreciate the upside of quittingÃ¢â‚¬â€because you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solve tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problem if you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t willing to abandon todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dud.\nLevitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can too. Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealingÃ¢â‚¬â€and so much fun to read.\n\n",
