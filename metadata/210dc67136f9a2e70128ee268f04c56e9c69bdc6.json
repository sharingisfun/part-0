Other singers were more popular, others were equally skilled, but few other African-American musicians were so influential over the course of popular music. And no other musician, pop or otherwise, put on a more exciting, exhilarating stage show: Brown's performances were marvels of athletic stamina and split-second timing.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.I Got You (I Feel Good)\n02.Mother\n03.Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine\n04.It's A Man's, Man's, Man's World\n05.Super Bad\n06.Get On The Good Foot\n07.Soul Power\n08.I Don't Want Nobody To Give Me Nothing (Open Up The Door, I'll Get It Myself)\n09.Get Up Offa That Thing\n10.Give It Up Or Turn It A Loose\n11.Hot Pants\n12.I Got To Move\n13.I Got The Feelin'\n14.Cold Sweat\n15.Papa Don't Take No Mess (Live)\n16.My Thang\n17.Funky President (People It's Bad)\n18.There Was A Time\n19.Hey America\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Bodyheat\n02.Make It Funky\n03.It's Too Funky In Here\n04.Funky Drummer\n05.King Heroin\n06.The Boss\n07.Licking Stick - Licking Stick\n08.Money Won't Change You\n09.Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\n10.Say It Loud - I'm Black And I'm Proud\n11.Talkin' Loud And Sayin' Nothing\n12.Out Of Sight\n13.Think\n14.Prisoner Of Love\n15.Night Train\n16.I'll Go Crazy\n17.Lost Someone\n18.Doing It To Death\n19.Good Good Lovin'\n20.Try Me\n21.Please, Please, Please\n22.Living In America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
