Despite band founder Peter Green naming the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood, McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts. The keyboardist, Christine McVie, has, to date, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.The two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with &quot;Albatross&quot;; and from 1975 to 1987, with more pop-orientation, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song &quot;Dreams&quot;, which was the band's first and only U.S. number one) and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the ninth highest selling album of all time.\n\n.: Fleetwood Mac Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/7282/fleetwood20mac1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/7282/fleetwood20mac1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\nBlue Horizon Box (1999) @320\\CD1 1968 Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac @320\nBlue Horizon Box (1999) @320\\CD2 1968 Mr Wonderful @320\nBlue Horizon Box (1999) @320\\CD3 1969 Pious Bird of Good Omen @320\nBlue Horizon Box (1999) @320\\CD4 1970 Blues Jam in Chicago vol 1 @320\nBlue Horizon Box (1999) @320\\CD5 1970 Blues Jam in Chicago vol 2 @320\nBlue Horizon Box (1999) @320\\CD6 1971 The Original Fleetwood Mac @320\n1968 7936 South Rhodes (with Eddie Boyd) @320\n1969 Then Play On @320\n1970 Jumping At Shadows (With Peter Green)(2 CD) @320\n1970 Kiln House @320\n1971 Future Games @320\n1972 Bare Trees @320\n1973 Mystery To Me @320\n1973 Penguin @320\n1974 Heroes Are Hard to Find @320\n1975 Fleetwood Mac (U.S. Deluxe &amp; Expanded Edition) @320\n1977 Albatross (and Christine Perfect) @320\n1977 Rumours @320\n1977 Rumours Outtakes @320\n1979 Tusk (Remaster, 2 CD) @320\n1982 Mirage @320\n1987 Tango in the Night @320\n1990 Behind the Mask @320\n1995 Time @320\n2003 Say You Will (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD) @320\n\nLive albums\n1968 SF,Carousel Ballroom (2 CD) @320\n1969 The Biggest Thing Since Colossus (With Otis Spann) @320\n1970 Live In Boston (3 CD, 2003) @320\n1971 Live at The BBC 1967-1971 (2 CD, 1995) @320\n1975 Who's The New Girl (Tape) @320\n1977 Oklahoma City @320\n1980 Fleetwood Mac Live (2 CD) @320\n1997 The Dance Live @320\n1997 Westwood One (2001, Live-Radio, 2 CD) @320\n\nCompilation albums\n1969 English Rose @320\n1970 The Vaudeville Years (1998, 2 CD) @320\n1975 Fleetwood Mac @320\n1990 Greatest Hits @320\n2000 The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac @320\n\nTribute albums\n1994 The London Rock Orchestra Plays Fleetwood Mac @320\n2009 The Soundstage Sessions (Stevie Nicks) @320",
