What account do I use? If you select Skype Name and use your existing (personal/home) account it will configure the computer to use two identities - Skype for your personal account and Skype for Business for your work account. If you select Microsoft Account, it will create a new Live ID with your work email address - something you probably don't want to do.\r\n\r\n** Office Telemetry (why you might not want to share your data)\r\n\r\nTelemetry Dashboard displays the file names and titles of documents in each userâ€™s Most Recently Used list, which might reveal personal or confidential information about the user or organization. The names of add-ins and other solutions that are used by Office are also displayed.\r\n\r\nThe telemetry agent collects inventory, usage, and other application data and uploads it to a shared folder, where it is processed by a service known as the telemetry processor and inserted into an SQL database. The Telemetry Dashboard connects to this database so that it can show the usage of Office files, add-ins, and solutions.\r\n\r\nBonus folder\r\n\r\n- KMSpico 10.2.0 + Microsoft Toolkit 2.6 BETA 5 (activators)\r\n- Classic Menu for Office v5.85 (adds Office 2003 type toolbars and menus to Office 2013)\r\n- Office Tab v9.81 (edit multiple files within a single tabbed window)\r\n- Previous versions uninstallers (Office 2003, 2007, 2010)\r\n- Disable/Restore 'Sign In' option in Office applications (reg file)\r\n- Disable/Restore Office 2013 Telemetry (reg file)\r\n\r\nSource files\r\n\r\nSW_DVD5_Office_Professional_Plus_2013w_SP1_W32_English_MLF_X19-35821.ISO\r\nSW_DVD5_Office_Professional_Plus_2013w_SP1_64Bit_English_MLF_X19-35976.ISO\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\n- Delete any previously installed version using the provided uninstallers (bonus folder) and reboot if required\r\n- Mount / burn / extract ISO file\r\n- Install Office 2013\r\n- Activate using Microsoft Toolkit 2.5.3 (bonus folder, click the Office button, install AutoKMS, and click the Activate button)\r\n- Install Visual Studio for Office Runtime (bonus folder)\r\n\r\nOptional\r\n\r\n- Classic Menu for Office v5.85 + serial\r\n- Office Tab v9.81 + serial\r\n- Merge reg file Remove/Restore Sign In Office 2013 to remove/restore the Sign in option (reboot required)\r\n- Merge reg file Disable/Restore Office 2013 Telemetry to remove/restore Telemetry\r\n\r\nSystem requirements\r\n\r\nWindows 10/8.1/8,7 SP1 + Server/Server 2012 R2/2012/Server 2008 R2 (64-bit version for Office 64-bit)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b2a0a81ca5ea354f2b3d2afc9557f01b178e203","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+2013+VL+ProPlus+English+%28x86-x64%29+June+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b2a0a81ca5ea354f2b3d2afc9557f01b178e203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,42,10,129,202,94,163,84,242,179,210,175,201,85,127,1,177,120,226,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
