  "description": "Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes - Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo [epub]\r\n\r\nA preeminent geneticist hunts the Neanderthal genome to answer the biggest question of them all: what does it mean to be human?\r\n\r\nWhat can we learn from the genes of our closest evolutionary relatives? Neanderthal Man tells the story of geneticist Svante PÃ¤Ã¤boâ€™s mission to answer that question, beginning with the study of DNA in Egyptian mummies in the early 1980s and culminating in his sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2009. From PÃ¤Ã¤bo, we learn how Neanderthal genes offer a unique window into the lives of our hominid relatives and may hold the key to unlocking the mystery of why humans survived while Neanderthals went extinct. Drawing on genetic and fossil clues, PÃ¤Ã¤bo explores what is known about the origin of modern humans and their relationship to the Neanderthals and describes the fierce debate surrounding the nature of the two speciesâ€™ interactions.\r\n\r\nA riveting story about a visionary researcher and the nature of scientific inquiry, Neanderthal Man offers rich insight into the fundamental question of who we are",
