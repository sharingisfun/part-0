  "description": "     The Librarians' follows on from the hit TNT TV Movie's. The show centers on an ancient organization who are hidden beneath the Metropolitan Public Library. The organization is dedicated to protecting the unknowing world from the magic that is all around them. The show follows Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle) who has been the librarian for the past 10 years, however things are getting too much for him alone to handle and so four new librarians from around the world have been hired - Eve Baird (Rebecca Romijn), Jacob Stone (Christian Kane), Cassandra Cillian (Lindy Booth) and Ezekiel Jones (John Kim). Looking after the new team, is caretaker Jenkins (John Larroquette). Noah Wyle will appear in a recurring capacity, whilst Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin are set to reprise their movie roles in a guest capacity",
