The game presents five new campaigns, each composed of five smaller maps. In the first four maps of any campaign, the survivors attempt to reach a safehouse, while the final stage requires the survivors to call for rescue and hold against a large horde of infected while they wait.\n\nEach survivor can carry one main weapon and either one or two pistols or one of several melee weapons introduced in Left 4 Dead 2 such as frying pans or chainsaws. Though melee weapons will cause extra damage to the infected when struck, the survivors can use any other weapon or item for weaker melee attacks and to temporarily push the infected back. They also carry a flashlight, which can be used to maneuver in dark areas but may startle the infected; a first aid kit or defibrillator kit which can be used to heal or revive other survivors respectively; pain pills or adrenaline shots that give a temporary burst of health recovery and agility; and a throwable weaponÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a Molotov cocktail to set an area on fire, a pipe bomb modified with smoke alarm to attract a large number of infected before detonating, and new to Left 4 Dead 2, a vial containing Boomer bile, which can be thrown at infected to cause them to turn on each other. A supply of these weapons and items and additional ammunition are generally found at the start of each campaign and within safehouses, but may also be found scattered about the level.\n\nAs the survivors make their way through the campaign, they must work together to make their way to the safehouse and rescue. Players are shown the health and status of their fellow survivors, and should they not be in sight, will also be shown the silhouette of the other survivors. Taking damage from the infected will cause the survivor to lose health, and their actions will become slower as more damage is taken. If a survivor takes too much damage, they will become incapacitated, and forced to fight off the infected using pistols until rescued by another survivor or dying from further damage; the character remains dead until the next level, or, in Campaign mode, reappears in a &quot;rescue closet&quot; to be freed by the other survivors. Many of the special infected can quickly finish off a survivor if they are not rescued, and thus the game encourages players to stay as a group and work together to traverse the level safely. Should all the survivors be killed or incapacitated, the game is over, and players will have to restart that level. While most events the players experience are semi-randomly generated by the game's AI Director, some levels feature staged events which, when triggered by a survivor, will cause the players to be rushed by a horde of infected.\n\n\n\nMINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS :\n=============================\n\nOperating System: Windows 7 / Windows Vista / Windows Vista64 / Windows XP\nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 3.0 GHz\nMemory: 1 GB for XP / 2GB for Vista\nHard Drive: 7.5 GB Free\nVideo Card (graphics): DirectX 9 compatible video card with 128 MB, Shader model 2.0.
