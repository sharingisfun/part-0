  "description": "image\nOrange Is the New Black revolves around Piper Chapman (Schilling), a New York woman, who is sent to a women's federal prison for possessing a suitcase full of drug money for Alex Vause (Prepon), an international drug smuggler and Chapman's one-time lover. Sentenced to serve a fifteen-month sentence, Chapman must survive the hardships of prison life, as she may have to be a different person to do so.\n\nCreator Jenji Kohan hasn't just given us an intriguingly compromised lead character, she's also created an entire world, an alternately sly and sad pressure cooker that offers an enticing range of complicated relationships and unstable power dynamics. But what may be most impressive is the fact that Kohan and her writers have fun with a whole array of &quot;Women in Prison&quot; tropes while allowing many of the central characters to have dignity, depth and even moments of pathos. This mixture of melodrama, subversive comedy and drama could have been a big ol' mess, but &quot;Orange&quot; ends up a rich, flavorful stew.\n\nSeries Cast\n\nTaylor Schilling... Piper Chapman / ...
