It was the starting point of a roller-coaster journey that has gone on to include massive hit singles, multi-platinum selling albums, three Brit Awards, a Grammy, an Ivor Novello, 10 MTV Awards, the 2012 Olympic closing ceremonyÂ¬ and worldwide DJ superstardom which continues to this day with a hectic schedule of DJ performances and festival headliner shows.\r\n\r\nThis album celebrates where it all began - the brilliant original album - a seminal dance music moment in history, and expands on the story with a whole disc of bonus tracks including recordings from the Fatboy vaults that have never been released before. The 2CD expanded edition includes sleevenotes from Skint label founder Damian Harris",
