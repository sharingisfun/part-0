  "description": "SPSS 20 (x86 &amp; x64) Multilanguaje\n\nIBM SPSS Statistics is the ultimate tool for managing your statistics data and research.\n\nThis super-app affords you complete control over your data. It allows you to make complex graphs and illustrations from statistics and is firmly aimed at professionals who want to solve business and research problems. To facilitate this, SPSS features a wide range of analytical functions that take the pain out of collating data.\n\nSPSS offers detailed analysis options to look deeper into your data and spot trends that you might not have noticed. You can test out hundreds of different variables on your data to see how figures or performance would change under different circumstances, while the app contains multiple advanced features that will allow you get the max from your data.\n\nAn array of features\n\nAmong these features are excellent sharing options, automated models, the ability to operate server versions of IBM SPSS Statistics Base and modules on IBM mainframe servers, a syntax editor, integration with Microsoft Office, and much, much more. In order to get a better idea of the functions and features, take a look here.\n\nObviously, such power comes at a price. The SPSS download is pretty large, and once you do have the program installed, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a pretty steep learning curve until you find your feet. You could argue that SPSS is actually a glorified version of Excel, but with far more options and power behind it, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an impressive beast. As a result, domestic users may be intimidated and would be better off getting started on a simpler data management app.\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re serious about statistics, then SPSS is as good as it gets.\n\nPros:\n\nHundreds of graphical options\nPowerful analytical features\nMicrosoft Office integration\nMultilingual options\nExcellent sharing options",
