  "description": "\nJORGE LUIS BORGES (1899-1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator.  His best-known books are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes, including dreams, labyrinths, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, philosophy, and religion.  Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals.  He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer.  In 1955 he was appointed director of the National Public Library and professor of Literature at the University of Buenos Aires.  He became completely blind at the age of 55; as he never learned braille, he became unable to read.  Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination.\n\nHis international reputation was consolidated in the 1960s when he received the first Prix International, which he shared with Samuel Beckett; with the publication of a major anthology, LABYRINTHS (1962); the beginning of a collaboration with the American translator Norman Thomas di Giovanni; and the boom in Latin American literature following the success of GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez's &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;.  \n\nWriter and essayist J. M. Coetzee said of him: &quot;He, more than anyone, renovated the language of fiction and thus opened the way to a remarkable generation of Spanish American novelists.&quot;  Other critics have deemed Borges the most important figure in Spanish-language literature since Cervantes.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* THE ALEPH &amp; OTHER STORIES, 1933-1969 (Bantam, 1971).
