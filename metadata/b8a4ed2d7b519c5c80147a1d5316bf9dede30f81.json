  "description": "Pantera\nThe Best Of Pantera\nFar Beyond The Great\nSouthern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits! (2003)\n\n\nThe preeminent metal band of the early to mid-'90s, Pantera put to rest any and all remnants of the '80s metal scene, almost single-handedly demolishing any notion that hair metal, speed metal, power metal, et al., were anything but passÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. Loathe to admit it, the Texas band had in fact been one of those '80s metal bands, releasing fairly unsuccessful (and later disowned) glam-inspired music throughout much of the decade. The about-face came with the addition of vocalist Phil Anselmo, and the key turning point was the band's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990). Pantera's mainstream breakthrough came next with Vulgar Display of Power (1992), their second major-label album, which thrust the band to the forefront of the metal scene, alongside such veteran bands as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, as well as fellow up-and-comers Sepultura and White Zombie. By the time Pantera unleashed Far Beyond Driven (1994), after two long years of touring, they were the most popular metal band in the land: the new album debuted atop the Billboard Top 200 as its lead single, &quot;I'm Broken,&quot; was getting massive airplay.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\t\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tElektra/Wea\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Cowboys From Hell\n02.Cemetery Gates\n03.Mouth For War\n04.Walk\n05.This Love\n06.I'm Broken\n07.Becoming\n08.5 Minutes Alone\n09.Planet Caravan\n10.Drag The Waters\n11.Where You Come From\n12.Cat Scratch Fever\n13.Revolution Is My Name\n14.I'll Cast A Shadow\n15.Goddamn Electric\n16.Hole In The Sky (Non LP Track)\n\n\nCheers!",
