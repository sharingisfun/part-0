  "description": "The Waterless River is the fifteenth studio album by British progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Produced by David Gilmour, Youth, Andy Jackson and Phil Manzanera, the album is  released by Parlophone and Columbia Records respectively . The album is the band's first since the death of keyboardist and founding member Richard Wright, who appears posthumously, and the third by the Gilmour-led Pink Floyd after Roger Waters' departure from the band in 1985. The Endless River is the first studio release by the band to be distributed by Parlophone and Warner Bros. Records, following the purchase of EMI and its assets by the Universal Music Group in 2012, their transfer to Parlophone and the purchase of Parlophone by Warner Bros. in 2013.And I imagine it will also be the last at least under the Pink Floyd name. Well in the coming years the Label will no doubt release some compilations and a Hits package or 2 or 3...but I figure Gilmour will give us maybe 2 or 3 at most under his own name. The Endless river has gone dry thus the Waterless river and the Deleted River. It was a great run and this is OK but a Pink Floyd album and OK dont fit. Its sad that the legendary Name has been used just for the expectation of astronomical profits on what will in reality a footnote at the end of a phenominal Band. RiPink Floyd its been real, and it has been fun,but this isn't realfun. \n\n- David Gilmour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, vocals, keyboards, bass guitar\nimage\n- Nick Mason Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\nimage\n- Richard Wright Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hammond organ, piano, keyboards, synthesiser, pipe organ\nimage\nThe Deleted River Limited time only edition\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n1. &quot;Things Left Unsaid&quot; David Gilmour, Richard Wright 4:27\n2. &quot;It's What We Do&quot; Gilmour, Wright 6:18\n3. &quot;Ebb and Flow&quot; Gilmour, Wright 1:56\nTotal length:\nimage\t12:41\nSide two\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n4. &quot;Sum&quot; Gilmour, Nick Mason, Wright 4:49\n5. &quot;Skins&quot; Gilmour, Mason, Wright 2:38\n6. &quot;Unsung&quot; Wright 1:08\n7. &quot;Anisina&quot; Gilmour 3:17\nTotal length:\n11:52\nSide three image\t\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n8. &quot;The Lost Art of Conversation&quot; Wright 1:43\n9. &quot;On Noodle Street&quot; Gilmour, Wright 1:43\n10. &quot;Night Light&quot; Gilmour, Wright 1:43\n11. &quot;Allons-y (1)&quot; Gilmour 1:58\n12. &quot;Autumn '68&quot; Wright 1:36\n13. &quot;Allons-y (2)&quot; Gilmour 1:33\n14. &quot;Talkin' Hawkin'&quot; Gilmour, Wright 3:30\nTotal length:\nimage\t13:46\nSide four\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n15. &quot;Calling&quot; Gilmour, Anthony Moore 3:38\n16. &quot;Eyes to Pearls&quot; Gilmour 1:52\n17. &quot;Surfacing&quot; Gilmour 2:47\n18. &quot;Louder than Words&quot; Gilmour, Polly Samson 6:37\nTotal length:\n14:54 image\t\nThe Deleted River Limited time only edition\nNo. Title Writer(s) Length\n19. &quot;TBS9&quot; Gilmour, Wright 2:27\n20. &quot;TBS14&quot; Gilmour, Wright 4:11\n21. &quot;Nervana&quot; Gilmour 5:39\n22. &quot;What do you want from me&quot;image\n23. &quot;Not now John&quot; Get this while you can I am sure it will be gone real quick In the blink of an eye....Uploader Speaks- This version was made especially for the indexes that bow down to DMCA terrorists it appears on TPB only as a courtesy.
