If I'm James Dean,You're Audrey Hepburn\n2. The BombCom V2.0\n3. You Kill Me (In a Good Way)\n4. Let Love Bleed Red\n5. Captain Tyin Knots Vs Mr. Walkway (No Way)\n6. Don't Fall Asleep at the Helm\n7. With Ears to See, and Eyes to Hear\n8. In Case of Emergency, Dial 411\n9. The Left Side of Everywhere\n10. Dance Party*\n\nTotal Length: 31 minutes\n\n*this is an odd addition to the cd, because on the back of the case it shows a link to avideo which is the band dancing to some pop song and humiliating themselves, but on the actual cd it is a 90 second track with pianos and shit...dunno\n\nAll in all, its a great listen. Sleeping with Sirens have done a good job in capturing the vibe with their debut release\nIf you like it too, dont forget to buy the cd or their merchandise and support them...and PLEASE SEED! :)\n\n!! note: ive noticed that some files have incomplete names , which probably occurred when i converted from aac to mp3, so apoligies for that but im sure it wont be too hard for you to finish off the names ;)!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce9ea3539ef00782ffbaf71936dd219a18fe964","amp;dn":"Sleeping+With+Sirens+-With+Ears+To+See+%26+Eyes+To+Hear+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce9ea3539ef00782ffbaf71936dd219a18fe964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,233,234,53,57,239,0,120,47,251,175,113,147,109,210,25,161,143,233,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
