Now you are free to ask.\n\nDescription (kind of a spoiler, but not really)\nSeason 5 explores the news media, particularly the Baltimore Sun, and contains a Jayson Blair-like plotline. Marlo moves to gain even more control over the drug trade in Baltimore. McNulty goes off the deep end. Freamon and Pearlman are on Clay Davis, and thanks to the financial mismanagement of Carcetti, the &quot;fixing&quot; of city's PD becomes a back-burner issue.\n\nOh and in the interest of full disclosure, the video gets choppy in one episode for 2 seconds. I've watched them all, and had no other problems. All tested in my dvd player and work fine. Happy watching everyone.\n\nHow great was this show?\n\nFeedback is appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f382c5a6f7927053b6915cf9a4c56666d3d28b9","amp;dn":"The+Wire+-+Season+5+Complete+High+Quality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f382c5a6f7927053b6915cf9a4c56666d3d28b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,56,44,90,111,121,39,5,59,105,21,207,154,76,86,102,109,61,40,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
