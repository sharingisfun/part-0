  "description": "PHILIP ROTH (b. 1933) is an American novelist and short-story writer, and one of the most award-winning writers of his generation.  His work is characterized by an acute ear for dialogue, a concern with Jewish and American middle-class life, and the painful entanglements of sexual and familial love.  Much of his fiction revolves around semi-autobiographical themes, while self-consciously and playfully addressing the perils of establishing connections between the author Philip Roth and his fictional lives and voices.\n\nHe first gained attention with the novella GOODBYE, COLUMBUS (1959), an irreverent and humorous portrait of American Jewish life.  His profile rose significantly after the publication of the controversial PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT (1969), an audacious satirical portrait of a contemporary lust-ridden Jewish bachelor at odds with his domineering mother.  During the 1970s Roth experimented in various modes, from the political satire OUR GANG (1971) to the Kafkaesque THE BREAST (1972).  THE GHOST WRITER (1979) introduced an aspiring young writer named Nathan Zuckerman, whose subsequent life and career are traced in two subsequent novels, ZUCKERMAN UNBOUND (1981) and THE ANATOMY LESSON (1983) (the so-called first Zuckerman trilogy).\n\nRoth was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for AMERICAN PASTORAL (1997), a novel about a middle-class couple whose daughter becomes a terrorist.  It is the first novel of a second Zuckerman trilogy, completed by I MARRIED A COMMUNIST (1998) and THE HUMAN STAIN (2000), which focus on the McCarthy era and identity politics in 1990s America, respectively.  THE DYING ANIMAL (2001) is a short novel in which an aging literary professor reflects on a life of emotional isolation.  In THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA (2004), Roth imagines an alternative American history in which Charles Lindbergh is elected President in 1940, who embarks on a program of anti-Semitism.\n\nHis later works are informed by an increasingly pronounced preoccupation with mortality and with the failure of the aging body and mind.  EVERYMAN (2006) is a meditation on illness, aging, desire, and death.  EXIT GHOST (2007) revisits Zuckerman, who has been reawoken to life's possibilities after more than a decade of self-imposed exile in the Berkshire Mountains.  INDIGNATION (2008) is narrated from the afterlife by a man who died at age 19.  THE HUMBLING (2009) revisits Everyman's mortality-obsessed terrain, this time through the lens of an aging actor who, realizing that he has lost his talent, finds himself unable to work.  A polio epidemic is at the centre of NEMESIS (2010).\n\nIn October 2012, in an interview with a French magazine, Roth announced that he would be retiring from being an author and subsequently confirmed in Le Monde that he would no longer publish any fiction. \n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                                 == FICTION ==\n\n* American Pastoral (Houghton Mifflin, 1997)\n* Anatomy Lesson, The (FSG, 2013)\n* Breast, The (FSG, 1980)\n* Counterlife, The (Vintage, 1996 / FSG, 2013) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Deception, (Vintage, 2006)\n* Dying Animal, The (Houghton Mifflin, 2001)\n* Everyman (Houghton Mifflin, 2006)\n* Exit Ghost (Houghton Mifflin, 2007)\n* Ghost Writer, The (FSG, 2013)\n* Goodbye, Columbus &amp; Five Short Stories (Houghton Mifflin, 1989)\n* Great American Novel, The (FSG, 2013)\n* Human Stain, The (Houghton Mifflin, 2000)\n* Humbling, The (Houghton Mifflin, 2009)\n* I Married a Communist (Houghton Mifflin, 1998)\n* Indignation (Penguin, 2008)\n* Letting Go (Vintage, 1997)\n* My Life as a Man (Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1974) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Nemesis (Houghton Mifflin, 2010)\n* Operation Shylock (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993 / Vintage, 2000) -- PDF + ePUB\n* Our Gang (Vintage, 2001)\n* Plot Against America, The (Houghton Mifflin, 2004)\n* Portnoy's Complaint (Vintage, 1994)\n* Prague Orgy, The (FSG, 2013)\n* Professor of Desire, The (FSG, 2013)\n* Sabbath's Theater (Vintage, 1996)\n* When She Was Good (Vintage, 1995)\n* Zuckerman Unbound (FSG, 2013)\n\n\n                                == NON-FICTION ==\n\n* Art of Fiction, The (Paris Review, Fall 1984).
