She meets gregarious ladies' man and fellow painter Walter Keane in a park while she was struggling to make an impact with her drawings of children with big eyes. The two quickly become a pair with outgoing Walter selling their paintings and quiet Margaret holed up at home painting even more children with big eyes. But Walter's actually selling her paintings as his own. A clash of financial success and critical failure soon sends Margaret reeling in her life of lies. With Walter still living the high life, Margaret's going to have to try making it on her own again and re-claiming her name and her paintings. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f3d7e7404324eb032056568c18e5ddd4aa9701","amp;dn":"Big+Eyes+%282014%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f3d7e7404324eb032056568c18e5ddd4aa9701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,243,215,231,64,67,36,235,3,32,86,86,140,24,229,221,212,170,151,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
