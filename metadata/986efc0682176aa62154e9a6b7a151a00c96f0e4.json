  "description": "You have come to the right place.\n\nOnce you get the Adonis Golden Ratio system you will be brought to a calculator that will determine which category you fall into and then we will give you a program specific to your body and your goals.\n\nSo it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter if you are a skinny guy looking to build muscle, an overweight guy looking to lose weight and lean out or someone in between, meaning you want to pack on some muscle mass, but you know that you could lose some belly fat, either way we have you covered.\n\nThis system is specifically designed to help you:\nGet started\nLose the stubborn belly fat\nBuild muscle foundation\nMove you closer to your ideal body shape\n\nAnd as a bonus, you will also notice a huge improvement in strength and conditioning.\n\nOne thing is to have a workout and a completely different thing is to have a workout that meets your goals.\n\nWith the workouts there are basically three things you should be aware of - consistency, structure, variety.\n\nYou will find all three key aspects incorporated in the Adonis Golden Ratio Workout plans. Consistency is taken care for you by specifically planed workout days for each week. And you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just get four workout days to cycle over and over week after week. Workouts have to be fun, which is why every workout session is unique and includes a variety of different exercises.\n\nEach session is structured around your muscles that make up for your ideal shape (aka your Adonis Golden Ratio) - the last thing we would want for you is to spend all that time in the gym just to build an unattractive bulky body shape.\n\nThis system can really work as a base for your muscle building routines and diet plans. You can add cardio workouts to improve fat burning, you can add specializations (that are part of the system) to bring up your lagging parts and all while working towards your goal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ideal body shape.\n\nThis system is responsible for the best transformations online. Try it yourself today and judge by results, not by words - we offer a money back guarantee!\n\nSo whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part of the AGR system?\n\nYou will get the calculator that will help you determine which program you should follow, supplement guide, nutrition guide, months of workout plans, video tutorials and a couple other sweet bonuses we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell you about yet :).\n\nSo what are you waiting for?
