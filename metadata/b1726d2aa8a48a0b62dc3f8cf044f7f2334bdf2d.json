  "description": "The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo by Amy Schumer\r\nEnglish | 2016 | Biography &amp; Memoir | 47 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emmy Award-winning comedian, actress, writer, and star of Inside Amy Schumer and the acclaimed film Trainwreck has taken the entertainment world by storm with her winning blend of smart, satirical humor. Now, Amy Schumer has written a refreshingly candid and uproariously funny collection of (extremely) personal and observational essays.\r\n\r\nIn The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, Amy mines her past for stories about her teenage years, her family, relationships, and sex and shares the experiences that have shaped who she isâ€”a woman with the courage to bare her soul to stand up for what she believes in, all while making us laugh.\r\n\r\nRanging from the raucous to the romantic, the heartfelt to the harrowing, this highly entertaining and universally appealing collection is the literary equivalent of a night out with your best friendâ€”an unforgettable and fun adventure that you wish could last forever. Whether sheâ€™s experiencing lust-at-first-sight while in the airport security line, sharing her own views on love and marriage, admitting to being an introvert, or discovering her cross-fit instructorâ€™s secret bad habit, Amy Schumer proves to be a bighearted, brave, and thoughtful storyteller that will leave you nodding your head in recognition, laughing out loud, and sobbing uncontrollablyâ€”but only because itâ€™s over.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!",
