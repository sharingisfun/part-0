I checked each one carefully, cleaned up and\ncorrected the filenames and tagged them with the proper artist\n&amp; title. This is the end result. I left the collection titled\nas I found it and with the songs it came with. You'll find\nthough that it's not all soul, it's not all R&amp;B, it's not all\n&quot;black music&quot; and some songs don't seem to belong. But it's\nstill a great collection of wonderful old music. Enjoy.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArchie Bell &amp; The Drells - Tighten Up.mp3\nAretha Franklin - Chain Of Fools.mp3\nAretha Franklin - I Say A Little Prayer For You.mp3\nAretha Franklin - Respect.mp3\nAretha Franklin - Think.mp3\nBarrett Strong - Money (That's What I Want).mp3\nBen E.
