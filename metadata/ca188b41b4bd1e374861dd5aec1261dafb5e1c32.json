KONTAKT 5 takes a bold leap forward with 37 new filters, four new on-board studio effects, updated time-stretching, a new instrument bus system and more. As you will see from the new STUDIO DRUMMER, for example, it's a deep-rooted update to the KONTAKT platform, allowing us -- and you -- to create even better instruments and more powerful, expressive sounds.\n\n\nVAST 43 GB INSTRUMENT LIBRARY\n\nKONTAKT 5 includes a rich and diverse sound library with eight stunning Instrument Collections: Choir, Orchestral, World, Vintage, Band, Synth, Urban Beats and the new RETRO MACHINES MKII. In total, you get well over 1,000 different instruments, with over 43 GB of samples, all recorded and processed with meticulous attention to detail and quality.\n\nEvery instrument group has its own Performance View -- a clear, well-defined user interface, which puts all the important instrument controls up-front. This gives you a super-fast and efficient workflow, and makes it easy to manage the vast range of instruments on offer.\n\n\nDEEPTWEAKABILITY\n\nPlaying highly-responsive instruments is one thing -- tweaking, editing and creating instruments is another: KONTAKT 5 gives you both.\n\n[color=chocolate][b]With a detailed yet consistently straightforward interface, you can easily edit, loop, slice and time-stretch your sounds, pitch shift in real time or tempo-sync with the powerful Wave Editor.\n64 integrated effects provide a universal sound design toolset, brought to life by the powerful KONTAKT 5 sound engine with full surround sound support.\n\nFor deep editing, go under the hood and draw your own custom envelopes directly into the sample waveform. Or use step sequencers, flex envelopes and the new filters and effects to take your sound to entirely new places.\n\n\nBug fixes in 5.3.1:\n\nFixed crashes on OS X 10.9 Mavericks.\nFixed issues with libraries disappearing from the library tab in some cases.\nFixed a crash closing the plugin window in Fishman Tripleplay.\nFixed a crash related to purging samples while background loading in Drum Lab.\nFixed a crash with batch resave.\nFixed a crash loading the Limiter FX from the modules pane.\n\n\n\nSUPPORTED INTERFACES\n\n   Stand-alone\n   VST\n   Audio Units\n   RTAS (Pro Tools 9 + 10)\n   ASIO\n   CoreAudio\n   WASAPI\n   AAX Native (Pro Tools 10)\n   64-bit AAX plugins (Pro Tools 11)\n\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nWindows 7 or Windows 8 (latest Service Pack, 32/64-bit), Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Installation]\n\n       UnRar\n\n       Burn or mount the image.\n\n       Install the update.\n\n     \n\n\n         [Library Installation]\n\nTo use library for Kontakt Player/Intakt/Kompakt,\nyou need to add the information due to the protection scheme.\n\n1.Run the Kontakt.\n2.Click &quot;Libraries&quot; tab.\n3.Click &quot;Add Library&quot; button.\n4.Select the directory of the library.\n5.Done!\n\n\n         [Trouble Shooting For Library]\n\n\nWhen you experience well known error mesasge,\n&quot;This library is encrypted blah blah&quot;\nTry this :\n\n1.Delete the registry key related to that library\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARENative Instruments(LibName)\n\n2.Delete the from registry value related to that library\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARENative InstrumentsContent\n\n3.Delete the xml file related to that libary\n%Program Files%Common FilesNative InstrumentsService Center\n\n4.Now, run the Kontakt and add that library again.\n\n5.Give up if you still have the problem :D\n\nUnlocking library in Kontakt is not a complicated job.\nIf you just get errors on one or few libraries,\nit does not mean it is crack related.\n(Or, do you really think NI codes special lines to protect\nthose few libraries?
