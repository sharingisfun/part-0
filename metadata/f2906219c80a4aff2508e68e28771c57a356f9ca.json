Some dishes reflect Leeann's Chinese-American childhood or are recipes which Katie and Leeann developed while together. Others are creations that Katie has developed more recently. Woven throughout the book are fond memories and anecdotes from Katie's childhood, always involving cooking and eating with her mom. \r\n\r\nKatie Chin's Everyday Chinese Cooking is a celebration of Leeann Chin's amazing mastery of the complete array of flavors and techniques in Chinese cuisine, and her unique ability to make them accessible to Westerners. Katie provides tips and techniques which allow anyone to create a refined and tasty Chinese meal at home. \r\n\r\nFavorite Chinese recipes include:\r\n\r\nFirecracker Shrimp\r\nMu Shu Pork\r\nPeking Duck Summer Rolls\r\nGeneral Tso's Chicken\r\nTangerine Beef\r\nHoisin Lacquered Ribs\r\nTea-Smoked Sea Bass\r\nBanana Wontons\r\nFive Spice Chocolate Cake\r\nAnd many moreâ€¦\r\n\r\nLet yourself be inspired by the exquisite flavors of Leeann and Katie Chin's signature Chinese cuisine!",
