  "description": "Most accurate : More than 18 years experience in recognition technologies have enabled us to design and create the formidable OmniScore dual-engine recognition system, incredibly making PhotoScore Ultimate 7 over 99.5% accurate on most PDFs and originals!\n\nMost versatile : PhotoScore Ultimate 7 picks out virtually every detail and even recognizes 4 and 6 line guitar tablature, 1, 2 and 3 line percussion staves. It is the world's first and only commercial program available that is also designed to read handwritten scores.\n\nEasiest of use : Ease-of-use has been a central design aim right from the start, and with automatic scanning and recognition, plus licensed Sibelius-style editing interfaces, PhotoScore Ultimate 7 even becomes fun and exciting to use!\n\nPhotoScore Ultimate 7 reads virtually all markings in printed music, and most in handwritten music, including :\n\n- 5-line staves (normal and small), 4- and 6- line guitar staves, 1-, 2- and 3-line percussion staves\n- Notes, chords (including stem direction, beams &amp; flags) and rests (including multirests) in up to 4 voices per staff\n- Appoggiaturas (grace notes), cue-sized and cross-staff notes\n- Accidentals and articulation marks\n- Clefs, key signatures, time signatures\n- Tuplets/triplets\n- The format of the page, including the page size, staff size, margins, and where systems end\n- Slurs, ties and hairpins\n- Text including lyrics, dynamics, fingerings, instrument names, tempo and technique markings\n- Guitar chord diagrams\n- Various other markings such as codas, segnos, ornaments, pedal markings and repeat endings\n- 64 staves per page\n- 400 pages per score\n\nOnce the music has been PhotoScored with Ultimate you can...\n\n- Extract parts\n- Reformat the score\n- Transpose\n- Print out\n- Play back (using Espressivo technology licensed from Sibelius for astonishing realism!) - Guitar chord diagrams/frames are not played back, although guitar tablature staves are.\n- Send directly to Sibelius\n- Save as a MusicXML or NIFF file* and open in Finale or another music program \n- Save as a MIDI file and open in Pro Tools, Cubase, Sonar or another sequencing program*\n- Save as a WAV (Windows) or AIFF (Mac OS X) file for burning to CD or converting to MP3\n- Use the performance mode to easily read music off the screen whilst you are performing\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n- Pentium III (or equivalent AMD processor) or higher PC with Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / 7. At least 512MB is recommended. \n- Your computer should also have a reasonable amount of free hard disk space - at least 40MB and preferably rather more.\n- Adobe Reader 6.0 or later should be installed to view PhotoScoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PDF help.\n- Sibelius users note: Although PhotoScore will work with Sibelius version 3 and higher, It is recommended that you use Sibelius 5.0 or higher (Sibelius 7.0 for the best results) as it has greatly improved PhotoScore importing capabilities.\n- A scanner (probably connected to your computer via a USB, Printer or SCSI port), and installed TWAIN or WIA driver software.\n\nLanguage : English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neuratron.com/photoscore.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neuratron.com/photoscore.htm&lt;/a&gt;",
