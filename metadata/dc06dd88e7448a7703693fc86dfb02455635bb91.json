The band released only two albums during its first seven years, and finally found mainstream success with a self-titled release in 1996. It proved to be Sublime's last proper album, however, as lead singer Brad Nowell died in May 1996, just two months before the record's release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc06dd88e7448a7703693fc86dfb02455635bb91","amp;dn":"Sublime+-+Discography+%281992-2008%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc06dd88e7448a7703693fc86dfb02455635bb91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,6,221,136,231,68,138,119,3,105,63,200,109,251,2,69,86,53,187,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
