  "description": "I've created a portable version of the latest Warcraft III release from Battle.net. This means that it's pre-installed and is therefore very easy to share amongst friends on LAN parties.\n\nVersion number: 1.26 (latest verision pr march 2015)\n\nInside this torrent is a .RAR-file which can be opened with WinRAR. The RAR-file contains the entire gamefolder, so you only need to exract the RAR-file and start the game in order to play.\n\n- No crack needed\n- Works on Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1\n- Works on Local Area Network\n\n\nThe game is completely untouched and original. I've only made it portable and also added alot of maps that has been gathered by my friends over a decade. All maps are sorted by game type like Maul, Siege, Tower Defence, Wars, Footmen, Life as a Peasant etc.\n\nIf you get any problems, just write in the comments section below and I'll try to help as best as I can",
