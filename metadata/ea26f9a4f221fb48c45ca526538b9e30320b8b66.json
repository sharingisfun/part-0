  "description": "The Rolling Stones\nThe Very Best Of 1975-1994 Platinum Vol. 1 &amp; 2 (1995)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nBy the time the Rolling Stones began calling themselves the World's Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Band in the late '60s, they had already staked out an impressive claim on the title. As the self-consciously dangerous alternative to the bouncy Merseybeat of the Beatles in the British Invasion, the Stones had pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock &amp; roll that came to define hard rock. With his preening machismo and latent maliciousness, Mick Jagger became the prototypical rock frontman, tempering his macho showmanship with a detached, campy irony while Keith Richards and Brian Jones wrote the blueprint for sinewy, interlocking rhythm guitars. Backed by the strong yet subtly swinging rhythm section of bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, the Stones became the breakout band of the British blues scene, eclipsing such contemporaries as the Animals and Them. Over the course of their career, the Stones never really abandoned blues, but as soon as they reached popularity in the U.K., they began experimenting musically, incorporating the British pop of contemporaries like the Beatles, Kinks, and Who into their sound. After a brief dalliance with psychedelia, the Stones re-emerged in the late '60s as a jaded, blues-soaked hard rock quintet. The Stones always flirted with the seedy side of rock &amp; roll, but as the hippie dream began to break apart, they exposed and reveled in the new rock culture. It wasn't without difficulty, of course. Shortly after he was fired from the group, Jones was found dead in a swimming pool, while at a 1969 free concert at Altamont, a concertgoer was brutally killed during the Stones' show. But the Stones never stopped going. For the next 30 years, they continued to record and perform, and while their records weren't always blockbusters, they were never less than the most visible band of their era -- certainly, none of their British peers continued to be as popular or productive as the Stones. And no band since has proven to have such a broad fan base or far-reaching popularity, and it is impossible to hear any of the groups that followed them without detecting some sort of influence, whether it was musical or aesthetic.\n\n\nArtist...............: The Rolling Stones\nAlbum................: The Very Best Of 1975-1994 Platinum Vol. 1 &amp; 2\nGenre................: Classic Rock\nSource...............: CD {K&amp;J #4441 &amp; #4442} \nYear.................: 1995\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: Unofficial Poland Release\n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/18/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front, Back, CD, Inside\n\n\nVol. 1\n\n01.(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n02.Paint It, Black\n03.Under My Thumb\n04.Get Out Of My Cloud\n05.Angie\n06.As Tears Go By\n07.Jumpin' Jack Flash\n08.Honky Tonk Women\n09.Come On\n10.I Wanna Be Your Man\n11.Carol\n12.Heart Of Stone\n13.Lady Jane\n14.(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66\n15.Dance Little Sister\n16.It's Only Rock 'N' Roll\n17.Rip This Joint\n18.Play With Fire\n19.Ruby Tuesday\n20.You Can Make It If You Try\n21.She Said Yeah\n22.Suzie Q\n23.Gotta Get Away\n24.Look What You've Done\n25.Shake Your Hips\n26.She's A Rainbow\n\n\nVol. 2\n\n01.Harlem Shuffle\n02.Start Me Up\n03.Miss You\n04.Respectable\n05.Sex Drive\n06.Love Is Strong\n07.Sad Sad Sad\n08.Manish Boy\n09.Fool To Cry\n10.Hang Fire\n11.Hot Stuff\n12.Beast Of Burden\n13.You Got Me Rocking\n14.Crazy Mama\n15.Hold On To Your Hat\n16.Dirty Work\n17.Mixed Emotion\n18.It Must Be Hell\n19.New Faces\n20.The Worst\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t",
