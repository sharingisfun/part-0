While some speed gain\n         \nis possible even in single processor mode, best results\n         \nare achieved in multi-core environment.\n\n         \n**********************************************************************************\n\nSpeed gain depends on data type and average file size.\n         \nSeveral cores are utilized more efficiently when compressing\n         \nlarge files.\n\n      \nb) we had to increase memory requirements to achieve higher\n         \n   compression speed. General RAR compression algorithm allocates\n         \n   about 120 MB comparing to 40 MB in WinRAR 4.11;\n\n      \n\nc) RAR text compression algorithm cannot utilize several CPU cores\n         \n   efficiently, so its performance in multiprocessor environment\n         \n   is much lower than for general algorithm. Also its decompression\n           \n   speed is much lower than in general algorithm regardless of\n         \n   CPU number. So we decided to disable the text algorithm by default.\n\n         \n***********************************************************************************\n\n\n  If you need maximum possible compression ratio for plain text data\n         \n  regardless of speed, you can enable the text compression\n         \n  in &quot;Advanced compression parameter&quot; dialog. Press &quot;Compression...&quot;\n         \n  button on &quot;Advanced&quot; page of archiving dialog to access it.\n         \n  You can also change this option permanently in default compression\n         \n  profile;\n\n \n*********************************************************************************        \n\n  Fastest&quot; (-m1) compression mode also supports several processor\n         \n  cores now. In 4.11 it could use only a single processor core.\n\n  \n\n   RAR general decompression algorithm speed is slightly improved,\n      \n   though not to same extent as RAR compression. RAR decompression\n      \n   is not able to use several processor cores, so its performance\n      \n   does not depend on a number of cores.\n\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\n                Changes in ZIP compression:\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\n    now ZIP compression supports several processor cores resulting\n         \n    in noticeably higher performance in multi-core environment.\n         \n    Single CPU ZIP compression is also faster than in 4.11;\n\n    memory use for ZIP compression is increased to about 15 MB.\n\n   \n      For More Info Go To http://www.rarlab.com/rarnew.htm\n",
