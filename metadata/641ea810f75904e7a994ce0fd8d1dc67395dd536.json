  "description": "Toro Y Moi\nUnderneath The Pine (2011)\n\n\nChaz Bundick started making bedroom recordings under the name Toro y Moi in his native Columbia, SC in 2001. Drawing from a wide-ranging array of influences (Animal Collective, Daft Punk, and J Dilla among them), Bundick had a couple albums' worth of material ready for release eight years later. He was slated to release two full-length albums on Carpark Records in 2010: one, a dreamy, indie electronic affair (something like a cross between Panda Bear and Beach House); the other, a jumpy, garage-influenced indie pop effort that was influenced by bands like Saturday Looks Good to Me and Guided by Voices. In the meantime, Carpark released Toro y Moi's debut 7&quot; split single, Blessa/109, featuring one track from each of the forthcoming discs, in 2009. Only one album was actually issued in 2010, however, the dreamier Causers of This, which placed Toro y Moi right in the middle of the &quot;chillwave&quot; wave. By the time of his next album, early 2011's Underneath the Pine, Bundick had incorporated space age bachelor pad and disco influences into his sound, distancing himself from his chill contemporaries.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tElectronic/Pop\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tCarpark Records\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Intro Chi Chi\n02.New Beat\n03.Go With You\n04.Divina\n05.Before I'm Done\n06.Got Blinded\n07.How I Know\n08.Light Black\n09.Still Sound\n10.Good Hold\n11.Elise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n",
