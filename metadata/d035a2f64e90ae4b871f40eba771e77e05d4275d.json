He hires &quot;The Jackal&quot; -- an elusive, nasty assassin -- to kill FBI Director Donald Brown. Present at the shooting of Murad's brother were FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston and Major Valentina Koslova of the Russian militia. Nearly no one has ever seen The Jackal, save for Declan Mulqueen, an imprisoned IRA sniper. Upon learning that the Director Brown is a target, Preston and Koslova enlist the services of the reluctant Mulqueen to track down the Jackal before he can assassinate Brown. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d035a2f64e90ae4b871f40eba771e77e05d4275d","amp;dn":"The+Jackal+%281997%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d035a2f64e90ae4b871f40eba771e77e05d4275d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,53,162,246,78,144,174,75,135,31,64,235,167,113,231,126,5,212,39,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
