  "description": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/n3ooGtP.gif[/img]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/C4uu9J7.png[/img]\r\n[b][color=#806517][size=14]Vinyl is an exciting new drama series that explores the drug- and sex-fueled music business of the 1970s, played out through the story of a NYC record executive trying to revive his label and keep his personal life from spiraling out of control. A dizzying ride through Americaâ€™s music-business landscape at the dawn of punk, disco, and hip-hop, the story is seen through the eyes of Richie Finestra (Bobby Cannavale, EmmyÂ® for Boardwalk Empire), a major-label exec with a dark past and darker present. With his company, American Century Records, facing a number of client crises, and with his A&amp;R team having trouble landing important new acts, Richie, sober after years of drug and alcohol abuse, looks to sell his label to a West German conglomerate. But Richieâ€™s plans become complicated when he becomes embroiled in the death of a sleazy Long Island radio-company owner. Facing jail time, not to mention the loss of his disenchanted wife Devon (Olivia Wilde) and their two kids, Richie ends up reverting to his old vices, but has an epiphany during a concert at a Greenwich Village theater where the roof caves in on him - literally.[/size][/color][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/8MNhaKB.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/hRUTTIn.png[/img]\r\n[b][color=#008080][size=14]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/cgCkQTC.jpg[/img]\r\n Bobby Cannavale as Richie Finestra, a record executive trying to resurrect his label American Century.\r\n Ray Romano as Zak Yankovich, Richie's confidant and head of promotions at American Century.\r\n J.
