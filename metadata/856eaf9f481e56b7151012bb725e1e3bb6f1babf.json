The pipe and plate footing for the gag are shown falling away from the car(s) in un-processed scenes. \n\nThe character Ricky Bobby inspired a hip-hop song and national dance craze 'Do the Ricky-Bobby' started from a rapper named B-hamp from Texas. The dance has inspired tons of amateur videos showing their best Ricky Bobby dance including Cincinnati football player Ochocinco showcasing his best moves. \n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nTalladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby UNRATED 2006 720p BRrip_sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d69ebfb1be969ae2f8e7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 8 frames\nMuxing mode                      : Header stripping\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 2h 1mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 821 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 528 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.051\nWriting library                  : x264 core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\n\n\n\n\naudio details\n\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 2h 1mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\n\nlanguage                         english\n\nsubs                             english\n\n\n\nSAMPLE                  :included\n\n\n\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nPLOT:NASCAR stock car racing sensation Ricky Bobby is a national hero because of his &quot;win at all costs&quot; approach. He and his loyal racing partner, childhood friend Cal Naughton Jr., are a fearless duo -- &quot;Shake&quot; and &quot;Bake&quot; by their fans for their ability to finish so many races in the #1 and #2 positions, with Cal always in second place. When flamboyant French Formula One driver Jean Girard challenges &quot;Shake&quot; and &quot;Bake&quot; for the supremacy of NASCAR, Ricky Bobby must face his own demons and fight Girard for the right to be known as racing's top driver.\n\n\nDirector: Adam McKay\n\nStars:       Will Ferrell, John C.
