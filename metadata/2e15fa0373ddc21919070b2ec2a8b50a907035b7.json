  "description": "When fast-living novelist Hank Moody left the literary haunts of New York for the pleasure seeking splendors of LA, he thought he'd have fame, fortune and the love of a good woman. Now his personal life is in shambles, his career is on the brink of self-destruction and he still just can't stop yielding to every temptation. Golden GlobeÃ‚Â® winner David Duchovny stars in the Showtime Original series that takes you on a wild, witty, and sexy ride in the California fast lane.\n\nCAST\n\nimage\n\nDavid Duchovny as Hank Moody\n\nLife has been a rocky road of ups and downs for famed novelist and NYC transplant Hank Moody since he relocated to Los Angeles. He suffered through a crappy Hollywood adaptation of his prized tome, a single, tumultuous term as college professor, a felony conviction, and a near death experience at the hands of a psychopathic ex. Despite an intervention and a stint in rehab, Hank owns all his vices -- drink, drugs, and women -- with a refreshing sense of honesty and unapologetic candor. He's holding it together while falling apart, and he doesn't mind one bit.\n\nNatascha McElhone as Karen van der Beek\n\nKaren is Hank's long time, on-again/off-again girlfriend and the mother of his daughter. The talented architect has come close to cutting her ties with Hank for good more than once, but the irresistible chemistry she shares with him keeps bringing her back for more.\n\nMadeleine Martin as Becca Moody\n\nThe women may come and go, but Hank's heart truly belongs to his daughter. Hank and Karen's quick-witted offspring has seen it all -- watching her parents' complicated relationship, as well as her father's roller-coaster lifestyle. Now that she's off travelling the world and getting life experience, Hank and Karen must deal with being empty nesters for the first time.\n\nPamela Adlon as Marcy Runkle\n\nMarcy Runkle is a woman who never minces words. She's the brash, hardcore, unapologetic on-again/off-again/on-again wife of Hank's agent/best friend, Charlie and the mother of his child. But the couple is having some issues in the bedroom, and her ex Stu is still pining for her, all of which could jeopardize her newly reformed bond with Charlie.\n\nEvan Handler as Charlie Runkle\n\nHank's best friend and agent tries hard to find happiness in the shadow of Mr. Moody, but life is never easy with such a difficult client. His personal life is just as messy. He recently won back his estranged wife Marcy after she left him for a fabulously rich and well-endowed movie producer, but the question remains whether he'll be able to deliver the goods and keep her satisfied.\n\nGeneral\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nOverall bit rate : 1 380 Kbps\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.9.1 ('Blue Panther') 32bit built on Apr 18 2014 18:15:44\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0d45646a654d4139233c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 9 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate : 1 010 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.046\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2409kMod d6b4e63\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No",
