The question is: how far will you go to make it through another day?\r\nThis War of Mine: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also the fact that even in times of conflict, kids are still kids - they laugh, cry, play with toys and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to bring back the kid in yourself to understand how to protect the little ones. Their faith, and their futures, are in your hands.\r\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of young and adult civilians. At night, take one of your people on a mission to scavenge through a city for items that will help you stay alive.\r\nInspired by real-life events\r\nControl your survivors and manage your shelter\r\nTake care of innocent children - create toys for them and make them smile\r\nCraft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves â€“ anything that helps you survive\r\nMake decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience\r\nRandomized world and characters every time you start a new game\r\nCharcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo 2.4, AMD Athlon(TM) X2 2.8 Ghz\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: Geforce 9600 GS, Radeon HD4000, Shader Model 3.0, 512MB\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c\r\nSound Card: DirectX compatible\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee44443c2d12ff9d9c72864c58af21cc88c94bb0","amp;dn":"This+War+of+Mine%3A+The+Little+Ones+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee44443c2d12ff9d9c72864c58af21cc88c94bb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,68,68,60,45,18,255,157,156,114,134,76,88,175,33,204,136,201,75,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
