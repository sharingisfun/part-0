  "description": "Artist:            Bonobo (Simon Green)\nGenre:             Downbeat, Ambient, Breakbeat \nMoods:             Laid-Back/ Mellow, Nocturnal, Freewheeling, Detached\n\nFormat:            Mp3\nBitrate:           Variable; 112 to 256 kbps\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBiography:\nWith the experimental warmth of &amp;#039;60s French films and the pizzicato flavor of horizontal hip-hop, Simon Green&amp;#039;s Bonobo project established a welcome niche of a pretension-free, post-party intellectual chill-out. An almost silent figure among Ibizian romanticists, Green began in Brighton, debuting in 1999 with a track on Tru Thoughts Recordings&amp;#039; When Shapes Join Together compilation. Though tempted by offers from Mute and XL after the official issue of &quot;The Scuba EP&quot; and the &quot;Terrapin&quot; single, Green stuck with Tru Thoughts for the acclaimed debut LP Animal Magic. Highlighted by downtempo dub, funk, and an equally likable use of sitars, Animal Magic was an obvious success and plans were quickly made for careful European support appearances, as well as a follow-up album, Dial &quot;M&quot; for Monkey, for Coldcut&amp;#039;s Ninja Tune label. A tour to support the record followed and was documented on the 2005 EP Live Sessions.  \n                                                                     [AllMusic.com]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlbums:\n\n          Animal Magic\n          Dial &quot;M&quot; For Monkey\n          Sweetness\n          One Off&amp;#039;s Remixes &amp; B-Sides\n          Solid Steel (It Came From The Sea-Mixed By Bonobo)\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment:\nAs you may have noticed, the &quot;Live Sessions&quot; EP is missing. Bonobo is also giving out a CD later this year, that is not present in this &quot;discography&quot;.\nI have made this torrent befor, but for some reason, it suddenly felt like changing to 97,0% instead of 100%, so I&amp;#039;ll try again...\nIf you like this music, just check out my other uploads here: \n\n                                               &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Kiba&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Kiba&lt;/a&gt;",
