New HDR Merge lets you combine multiple photos taken with different exposure settings into a single high dynamic range image.\r\n\r\nWhat's New in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC:\r\nHDR images made easy\r\nCreate natural-looking or surreal images from extremely high-contrast scenes. Using HDR Merge, you can easily combine multiple shots taken with different exposure settings into a single high dynamic range image.\r\n\r\nStunning panoramas\r\nCapture superwide fields of view and amazing detail. Photomerge technology lets you stitch together multiple images, including raw files, to create seamless panoramas.\r\n\r\nFaster performance\r\nImport and perfect your photos faster than ever. Lightroom takes advantage of compatible graphics processors to boost its overall speed, especially when youÃ¢Â€â„¢re enhancing images in the Develop module.\r\n\r\nFacial recognition\r\nQuickly find images of family and friends, even without metadata tags. Select a face in one photo, and Lightroom searches for that person in all your other images.

New HTML5-compatible gallery templates work with the widest range of desktop and mobile browsers.\r\n\r\nBetter control of filters\r\nPrecisely control which parts of your image are affected by the Graduated or Radial filters. Now you can use a brush to edit the filterÃ¢Â€â„¢s mask, adding or subtracting filter effects wherever you want.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n- IntelÂ® or AMD processor with 64-bit support*\r\n- Windows 7 with Service Pack 1, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1\r\n- 2 GB of RAM (4 GB recommended)\r\n- 2 GB of available hard-disk space\r\n- DVD-ROM drive required if purchasing AdobeÂ® PhotoshopÂ® LightroomÂ® retail boxed version\r\n- OpenGL 3.3 and DirectX 10-capable video adapter for GPU-related functionality\r\n- Internet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, validation of subscriptions, and access to online services.\r\n\r\nWhat's New in Photoshop Lightroom CC \nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/lightroomjournal/",
