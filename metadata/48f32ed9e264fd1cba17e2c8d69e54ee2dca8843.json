The series first aired on August 12, 2013, on Nickelodeon in the United States and in Canada on TVOKids on September 2, 2013. Although it is considered a Nick Jr. show, the show is broadcast on Nickelodeon and TVOKids. The show is produced by Spin Master Entertainment in association with TVOKids and Nickelodeon, with the show's animation being produced by Guru Studio. On June 9, 2015, Nickelodeon announced that PAW Patrol had been renewed for a third season, which is slated to begin airing in late 2015.\r\n\r\nA tech-savvy boy named Ryder leads a pack of seven dogs: Chase, Marshall, Rubble, Rocky, Zuma, Skye and Everest (the last of which was added to the team in season two). With a unique blend of stunts, pop culture references and lots of child-friendly humor, the PAW Patrol works together on high-stakes rescue missions to protect the city of Adventure Bay. Their most frequent caller is a fisherman named Cap'n Turbot, who knows a lot about the ocean and loves hanging out with the pups.\r\n\r\nFrom Marshall the firedog to Chase the police pup to Skye the pilot, each pup brings unique personality and skill to the team, modeling the importance of teamwork and good citizenship. They all have special Pup Packs on their backs to help them handle anything â€“ from repairing boats to saving a train from a rock slide. And no matter how big the adventure, the PAW Patrol always has time for a game, a laugh, and an ear scratch from Ryder.\r\nsure&quot;",
