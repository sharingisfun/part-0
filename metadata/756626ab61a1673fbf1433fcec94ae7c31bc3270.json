  "description": "Deftones Greatest Hits Disk 1 mp3  320kbps  ak6103 What we got...Deftones is an American alternative metal band from Sacramento, California, founded in 1988. The band consists of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion) and Sergio Vega (bass). The group's original bassist was Chi Cheng, who became comatose following a 2008 car accident and died in 2013. Deftones have released seven albums to date, with three Platinum (Adrenaline, Around the Fur, White Pony) and one Gold certification (for Deftones).\n\nContentsMusical style and influences\n\nAlthough initially rooted in heavy metal, Deftones have always claimed diverse influences, with their musical style diversifying over their career. Their sound has been described as alternative metal, art rock, experimental rock, nu metal, post-punk, post-hardcore, drone, progressive rock and progressive metal, shoegaze, post-rock, metalgaze or post-metal, dream pop, trip hop, psychedelic rock, and rap metal.\n\nOriginally, the band started off as being associated with and labeled under the &quot;nu metal&quot; movement. However, following the release of their third album, White Pony, they were widely acknowledged by many critics to have transcended the &quot;nu-metal&quot; label, eventually classified as having an alternative metal, post-metal, and experimental rock sound.\n\nCritic Johnny Loftus writes, &quot;Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement  Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like D.C. hardcore and dream pop into their Northern California alt-metal.&quot;\n\nMoreno's lyrics were described by Time magazine as &quot;suggesting emotions rather than announcing them.&quot; Chino Moreno himself has described his lyrics as ambiguous and sometimes impersonal, saying: &quot;I like to be ambiguous when writing to a certain extent, and throwing something so brash [as Chi's accident] against that and playing with it. And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it's not just connected with our personal story. It's not merely about our career and our lives, it's bigger than that. When I hear the music, I get inspired to paint the lyrical pictures you describe, but I'm not always talking about myself.&quot; The band's legacy has been compared to alternative rock group Radiohead, with some dubbing Deftones &quot;The Radiohead of metal&quot;.Eighth studio album (2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nIn March 2014, while Chino Moreno was touring with his side project Crosses in support of its self-titled debut album, the rest of Deftones began writing a followup to Koi No Yokan. Deftones also previously reported that they intend to record a new album either in late 2014 or early 2015.\n\nOn April 13, 2014, the first anniversary of Chi Cheng's death, Deftones released a track from the shelved Eros album titled &quot;Smile&quot;. The album was originally shelved after Cheng's accident and this is the first officially released material from it. The video was removed by Warner Bros. Records two days later due to copyright infringement, despite the track having been uploaded by Chino.Damn copywrite trolls even pull down material uploaded by its creator. 1-1 \tRocket Skates \t04:15\n1-2 \tHole In The Earth \t04:12\n1-3 \tChange (In The House Of Flies) \t05:00\n1-4 \tMinerva \t04:20\n1-5 \tDiamond Eyes \t03:10\n1-6 \tDigital Bath \t04:17\n1-7 \tIf Only Tonight We Could Sleep \t05:07\n1-8 \tMy Own Summer (Shove It) \t03:37\n1-9 \tBack To School (Mini Maggit) \t03:59\n1-10 \tNo Ordinary Love \t05:37\n1-11 \tMein \t04:01\n1-12 \tRoyal \t03:35\n1-13 \tFeiticeira \t03:12\n1-14 \tSavory \t04:38\n1-15 \tHexagram \t04:11\n1-16 \t7 Words \t03:46\n1-17 \tBe Quiet And Drive (Far Away) \t05:10\n1-18 \tBored \t04:08\n1-19 \tTeenager \t03:21\n\nWho knows some day ill get disk 2 if you want it ",
