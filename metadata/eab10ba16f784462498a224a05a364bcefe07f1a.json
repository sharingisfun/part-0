Originally conceived from experiments with three dimensional recording techniques and formed in two, interconnected parts, The Ship is almost as much musical novel as traditional album. Eno brings together beautiful songs, minimalist ambience, physical electronics omniscient narratives and technical innovation into a single, cinematic suite. The result is the very best of Eno, a record without parallel in his catalogue. This is the deluxe CD with 8 page booklet and 4 art cards in case bound wallet with spot gloss UV and cloth bound spine.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist: Brian Eno\r\nTitle: The Ship\r\nYear Of Release: 2016\r\nLabel: Warp Records\r\nGenre: Electronic, Ambient\r\nQuality: 320 Kbps\r\nTotal Time: 47:30 min\r\nTotal Size: 108 MB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
