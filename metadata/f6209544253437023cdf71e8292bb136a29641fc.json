  "description": "\nThe band's 1994 next album, The Division Bell, the title suggested by David's friend Douglas Adams, returned Pink Floyd to the No. 1 position in the UK &amp; US, remaining on the charts in each country for 51 weeks. The album contained Marooned, composed by David and Richard, for which the band received their first and only Grammy Award in 1995 (Best Rock Instrumental Performance).\n\nThe lengthy Division Bell tour, playing to more than 5 million people, engendered the live album P*U*L*S*E in 1995, featuring songs from concerts in London, Rome, Hanover, and Modena.\n\nOn January 17, 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend.\n\nRichard Wright released his second solo album, Broken China, in September 1996. Richard sings throughout, with Momentary Lapse collaborator Anthony Moore providing some lyrics, and Sinead OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor guesting on vocals for two tracks.\n\nA live recording of The Wall appeared in 2000, compiled from the 1980-1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released.\n\nIn 2003, The Dark Side Of The Moon was issued as an SACD, featuring new cover artwork. The album was also re-released as a 180-gram, virgin vinyl pressing, including all the original album art from the original release of the album, plus a new poster.\n\nNick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History Of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Nick made public promotional appearances in a few European and American cities, giving interviews and meeting fans at book signings.\n\nLongtime Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on October 30, 2003. David, Nick, and Richard joined together at his funeral service in Chichester Cathedral to perform Fat Old Sun and The Great Gig In The Sky.\n\nTwo years later, on July 2, 2005, the Gilmour / Mason / Waters / Wright lineup took to the stage for the first time in 24 years in a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. Their four-song set included Breathe (plus reprise), Money, Wish You Were Here, and Comfortably Numb, with David and Roger sharing lead vocals. At the end of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance, their group hug became one of the most famous images of Live 8.\n\nSubsequent to the post- Live 8 sales boom for the participating artists, David Gilmour declared that he would donate his share of profits to charity, urging other artists and record companies to do the same.\n\nOn November 16, 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. David and Nick attended in person; Richard was in hospital following eye surgery; and Roger appeared on a video screen, from Rome.\n\n\n\nOn March 6, 2006, David Gilmour released his third solo album, On An Island, which entered the charts at No. 1 in the UK and No. 6 in the US. A 3-month sold-out tour of concert venues in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. followed, performed with a band that included Richard Wright, plus Floyd regulars Dick Parry, Jon Carin, and Guy Pratt. Nick Mason joined the band for encores of Arnold Layne and Comfortably Numb at one of the Royal Albert Hall shows, which were filmed for the subsequent DVD / Blu-ray release Remember That Night.\n\nRoger Ã¢â‚¬ËœSydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Barrett died of pancreatic cancer on July 7, 2006 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, having suffered from diabetes for some time. His funeral was a private family affair, but his enduring influence was marked by the many heartfelt tributes recorded by fans and stars, touched by his idiosyncratic genius.\n\nOn July 10, 2006, the P*U*L*S*E DVD was released, launched with a media showing and Q&amp;A session with David, Nick and Richard.\n\nA tribute concert for Syd was held at the Barbican Centre in London on May 10, 2007. MadcapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Last Laugh featured entertaining performances from Barrett fans such as Chrissie Hynde, Mike Heron and Nick Laird-Clowes, while an unbilled Roger Waters played an acoustic Flickering Flame. Roger had to leave before the end of the show, so was unavailable for a further surprise performance - David, Richard and Nick performing Arnold Layne to rapturous applause and a standing ovation.\n\nSeptember 2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI, marked by the release of a 2-CD set containing mono and stereo mixes of The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, and a 3-CD version including the related singles, B sides and other rare recordings.\n\nOn December 10 (UK) and 11 (U.S.), 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh By The Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Two albums (The Dark Side Of The Moon and A Momentary Lapse Of Reason) feature remastered versions.\n\nOn January 7 2010, Pink FloydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s album artwork for The Division Bell, designed by Storm Thorgerson with sculptures by John Robertson, will be reproduced as a Royal Mail stamp. The series of Ã¢â‚¬ËœClassic Album CoverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stamps features 10 iconic album sleeves, and sees The Division Bell rub shoulders with titles such as Let It Bleed by The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin IV by Led Zeppelin, and A Rush Of Blood To The Head by Coldplay.\nGenre:\tRock\nSubgenre:\tArt-Rock / Progressive Rock trippin\nBitrate:\t160 k\nSize:\t76.87 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n21 files\nAdded:\t11/06/2014",
