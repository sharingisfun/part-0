  "description": "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\r\nGenre: Indie\r\nDeveloper: Steel Crate Games\r\nPublisher: Steel Crate Games\r\nRelease Date: 8 Oct, 2015\r\n\r\nAbout This Game\r\nIn Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is trapped in a virtual room with a ticking time bomb they must defuse. The other players are the â€œExpertsâ€ who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the bomb defusal manual. But thereâ€™s a catch: the experts canâ€™t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out â€“ fast!\r\n\r\nRounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always loud. Everybody has a role to play whether they are defusing the bomb or not. Swap out between rounds and share the experience with all of your friends!\r\n\r\nPuzzle solving and communication skills - and maybe a few friendships - will be put to the test as players race to defuse bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nChallenging puzzles that will test the limits of your communication skillsâ€¦ and friendships?\r\nA different bomb every time! Procedurally generated puzzles keep the action fresh.\r\nLocal multiplayer party game â€“ A great way to experience VR with all of your friends at the same time!\r\nOnly one copy of the game needed! If you can talk to the bomb defuser, you can be their expert! Try using your favorite voice chat service and playing remotely.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Windows 7 or higher\r\nAdditional Notes: A printed copy of the Bomb Defusal Manual or an additional web-enabled device to view the Bomb Defusal Manual is required. The Bomb Defusal Manual is freely available at www.bombmanual.com . Gamepad required for play with Oculus Rift. Oculus Rift DK2 required for VR play",
