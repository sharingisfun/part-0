On April 19, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll release Unplugged 1991/2001: The Complete Sessions, a 4xLP collection pairing together both of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sets for MTVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Unplugged acoustic performance series. The release include 11 songs that were not broadcast on MTV.\nThe Athens, Georgia quartetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first appearance on the program followed the release of seventh studio album Out of Time, which would become a massive hit off the strength of Top 10 singles like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Losing My ReligionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shiny Happy People.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Six of the setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 17 performances hail from tracks recorded during the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sessions, including non-LP B- sides Ã¢â‚¬Å“FretlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rotary 11.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Those two tracks, as well as acoustic renditions of DocumentÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs Ã¢â‚¬Å“Swan Swan HÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and GreenÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“World Leader Pretend,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were never included in the original broadcast and are heard here for the first time.\n\nAlmost exactly a decade later, R.E.M. reappeared on Unplugged a somewhat different band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not the least of which was due to the departure of drummer Bill Berry. In promotion of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album as a trio, Reveal, the group delivered a slightly more diverse set, stretching all the way back to 1984's Ã¢â‚¬Å“So. Central Rain (IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Sorry)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and including some of the best tracks from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early trio years, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Daysleeper,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“At My Most BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Imitation of Life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Six of the 16 performances from this set were excised from the original airing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270e2adc6d88d28e0fff4d05e92835d139733ad8","amp;dn":"R.E.M.+-+Unplugged+The+Complete+Sessions+%282014%29+%5BRecord+Store+Da","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270e2adc6d88d28e0fff4d05e92835d139733ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,14,42,220,109,136,210,142,15,255,77,5,233,40,53,209,57,115,58,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
