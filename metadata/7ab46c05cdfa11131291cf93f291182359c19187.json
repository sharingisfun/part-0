So Adam Roberts, creator of the award-winning blog The Amateur Gourmet, set out to cook in 50 of America's best kitchens to figure out how any average Joe or Jane can cook like a seasoned pro. From Alice Waters's garden to JosÃƒÂ© AndrÃƒÂ©s's home kitchen, it was a journey peppered with rock-star chefs and dedicated home cooks unified by a common passion, one that Roberts understands deeply and transfers to the reader with flair, thoughtfulness, and good humor: a love and appreciation of cooking. Roberts adapts recipes from Hugh Acheson, Lidia Bastianich, Roy Choi, Harold Dieterle, Sara Moulton, and more.\n\nThe culmination of that journey is a cookbook filled with lessons, tips, and tricks from the most admired chefs in America, including how to properly dress a salad, bake a no-fail piecrust, make light and airy pasta, and stir-fry in a wok, plus how to improve your knife skills, eliminate wasteful food practices, and create recipes of your very own. Most important, Roberts has adapted 150 of the chefs' signature recipes into totally doable dishes for the home cook. Now anyone can learn to cook like a pro!\n\nSecrets of the Best Chefs - USA December 2013\nBook Language: English \nPages: 400\nFile Type: Pdf, epub, mobi\nFile Size: 66 MB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/APMo8Nz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/APMo8Nz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab46c05cdfa11131291cf93f291182359c19187","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Best+Chefs+-+Adam+Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab46c05cdfa11131291cf93f291182359c19187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,180,108,5,205,250,17,19,18,145,207,147,242,145,24,35,89,193,145,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
