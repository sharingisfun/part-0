  "description": "Release: AVG PC TuneUp 2015 v15.0.1001.185 (c) 2014 AVG\r\nDate: 11/07/2014\r\n\r\nCracked By: Twisted EndZ\r\nRelease Type: Registration/Serial Crack, Activation Crack, Server Check Crack, Precracked, RegFile\r\nRELEASE NOTES\r\n\r\nRemember how your PC ran when you first got it?\r\n\r\nNew improved AVG PC TuneUp keeps your computer as good as new\r\nOur comprehensive range of 30 tools offer more speed, less\r\ncrashing and longer battery life for both novice and experienced\r\nusers\r\n\r\nNew features such as Live Optimization and Program Deactivator\r\nkeep your PC at top speed. Live Optimization works silently in\r\nthe background, constantly prioritizing all the applications that\r\nare running to increase loading speed and computer performance\r\n\r\nProgram Deactivator deactivates programs that you never user to\r\nstop them draining processor power speed without uninstalling\r\nthem. For those that want that extra bit of power, new Turbo Mode\r\nturns off over 70 processes with just one click\r\n\r\nEconomy Mode significantly prolongs battery life, which is\r\ninvaluable when you're on the go. One click reduces the power\r\nconsumption of the processor, switching off unnecessary\r\nbackground processes and reducing the power consumed by internal\r\nand external devices\r\n\r\nIt's always good when there's one less thing to remember. That's\r\nwhy we automatically run routine maintenance, including\r\noptimizing start up and both cleaning and defragmenting the\r\nregistry and hard drive. For novice users, we offer lots of\r\nstraightforward recommendations, and for expert users there are a\r\nrange of tools to fine tune to fine tune for even more\r\nperformance",
