I assure you that you need this disc if you are attempting to install Omnisphere. This was an original Air release. I am not the cracker, I am merely re-uploading it to the site.\n\n\nAfter many years of development, Spectrasonics is proud to release the brand new flagship virtual instrument Omnisphere. This epic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Power SynthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ breaks completely new sonic ground by combining a wide variety of hybrid realtime synthesis techniques, an epic library of remarkable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PsychoacousticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sounds, and many innovative features that have never been seen before in any hardware or software synthesizer. The new instrument is the first to be based on Spectrasonics newly developed STEAM Engine. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is truly an Epic project,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said Eric Persing, Founder and Creative Director of Spectrasonics. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe have been working for many, many years; sampling unique sounds, experimenting, specifying the synthesis features and building the STEAM Engine to run it all. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been a very exciting process involving our team of software engineers, sound designers, musicians, and graphic artists from all over the world. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been very deliberate in making it easy to use, and yet extremely powerful. Omnisphere is our new flagship synthesizer, and points the way to all our future virtual instruments. We are thrilled to offer a new product that will have a host of expansion capabilities in the future.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392dd7fb6a492c4513a2a708589b0d1b21e3e023","amp;dn":"Spectrasonics.Omnisphere.v1.0.VSTi.RTAS.AU.PC.MAC.DVDR.D1-AiRISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392dd7fb6a492c4513a2a708589b0d1b21e3e023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,45,215,251,106,73,44,69,19,162,167,8,88,155,13,27,33,227,224,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
