Discovering she was an Umbrella experiment, Alice has been bio-genetically enhanced with new strengths, senses and dexterity--and she will need them. In the heart of the ravaged Raccoon City, a small group of uninfected people, including Jill Valentine, a recently demoted member of Umbrella Corp&amp;#x27;s elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services team, and S.T.A.R.S team leader Carlos Oliveira, fight for their lives against swarms of Undead and the deadlier and faster Lickers. Running out of luck and resources, the group is rescued by Alice, and they begin to wage an exhilarating battle to survive and escape before the Umbrella Corporation erases its experiment from the face of the earth...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d560225b53a0e38642808ce42f801b9300be90d","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil%3A+Apocalypse+%282004%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d560225b53a0e38642808ce42f801b9300be90d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,86,2,37,181,58,14,56,100,40,8,206,66,248,1,185,48,11,233,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
