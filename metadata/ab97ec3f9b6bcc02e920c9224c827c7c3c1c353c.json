  "description": "PokÃ©mon GO is an augmented reality mobile game developed by Niantic for iOS and Android devices. Since its recent release, it has gained great popularity among gamers. Currently the game is only available in a few limited countries, however with Nox App Player you could play it anywhere in any country on your Windows PC without leaving your desk and collect all the PokÃ©mons. This is great for people who donâ€™t have the game yet in their country and of course also for people unable to get outdoors.\r\n\r\nFollow the below steps to play Pokemon Go on Windows PC:\r\n\r\nStep 1. Download and install Nox App Player: PokÃ©mon GO for PC version \r\nStep 2. Start up Nox App Player: PokÃ©mon GO for PC version, wait a few seconds and you will find the PokÃ©mon GO icon on the main window\r\nStep 3. Click PokÃ©mon GO icon, log in with your Google account and start play!\r\n\r\nMore tips and Highlights:\r\n\r\n1. IMPORTANT!! Before playing Pokemon GO, Pinpoint your position in GPS to the city you want to visit at first. Because the game will softbanned you when it detected your behavior in GPS from 1 city to another in just a mere seconds.\r\n\r\n2. AR: the augmented reality technology need to use your camera and capture your surrounding environment. This is apparently not suitable in the PC case. Make sure to turn AR off from the upper right corner of the game otherwise you may find a glitched screen.\r\n\r\n3. Keyboard control: in the game you could control your avatar to walk around using the WASD keys. Thereâ€™s also a hint on the screen. if you want to have a clear sight you could turn the hint off (the control still works) by clicking the Keyboard Control button on the side bar &gt;&gt; Click Save &gt;&gt; Turn transparency to Zero and click Yes.\r\nPokemon Go keyboard control\r\n\r\n4. Virtual location: The best part! Click on the Virtual Location button on the side bar and drag to pin yourself anywhere on the map, then click OK button at the bottom bar then you will â€œbeâ€ there instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Readme and Screenshot Included\r\n#Credit to : Nox App Player",
