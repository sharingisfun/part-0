  "description": "Mayday, also known as Air Crash Investigation in Australia, South Africa, Asia and some European countries, Air Emergency and Air Disasters in the United States.\nThe series features re-enactments, interviews, eyewitness testimony, computer-generated imagery, and in nearly all of the episodes, cockpit voice recordings to reconstruct the sequence of events to the audiences. Several passengers and crew members (whether they survived the incident or not) are picked and actors/actresses play the role of those passengers and crews throughout the flight usually starting from boarding of the flight. The flight routines in the air traffic control, cockpit and cabin are recreated on screen starting from departure up to the moment of the emergency. At the moment of the emergency, external view of the aircraft from different angles are recreated to show the effect and what had happened to the aircraft. The responses and reactions of the passengers, crews and air traffic control leading up to the eventual crash or emergency landing are then recreated. All the scenes in cockpit and air traffic control centers are recreated using the actual script obtained from the cockpit voice recorder of the aircraft and other recordings made at the time.\n\n..................................................................................\n\nI don't have a seedbox thus i have to prioritize\nmy share using this blocklist:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/wnblocklist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/wnblocklist&lt;/a&gt;\n\n..................................................................................\n\nPLEASE SEED THE TORRENT AFTER DOWNLOADING",
