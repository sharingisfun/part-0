  "description": "Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset 6.5 for Windows 7 are a complete suite of powerful and versatile tools released by Microsoft (formerly Winternals) that allows you to repair unbootable or locked-out systems, restore lost data, and diagnose system and network issues while the system is safely offline.\n\nSimplify desktop troubleshooting, repair, and recovery: The 14 tools in the toolset provide intuitive options for repair and recovery, even when the machine will not boot normally. The easy-to-use, offline boot environment helps IT teams quickly repair computers. They can recover deleted files, analyze crash dumps, and remove malware from infected systems while the operating system is offline. This helps protect other computers on the network and reduces the amount of time the computer is unavailable. Not sure which tool is the correct one, then answer the simple Solution Wizard questions to be pointed in the right direction. Additional key tools include Crash Analyzer, which helps determine the most likely cause of a crash, and Defender which helps detect malware and warn you of security risks. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/39524706280334656441.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/39524706280334656441.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/38384314488454569654.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/38384314488454569654.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
