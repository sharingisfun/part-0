Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their elaborate live performancesâ€”which featured fire breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through multiple lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons the only remaining original members. \r\n\r\nCounting the 1978 solo albums, Kiss has been awarded 30 gold albums to date, the most of any American band. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 25 million have been certified by the RIAA and their worldwide sales exceed 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals).\r\nBuoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. \r\nKiss has been named in many &quot;Top&quot; lists. These include Number 10 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;, 9th on &quot;The Greatest Metal Bands&quot; list by MTV, number one on Hit Paraders's &quot;Top 100 Live Bands&quot;, 56th on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists Of All Time&quot;, and 26th on Gibson's &quot;50 Greatest American Rock Bands&quot;. On April 10, 2014, Kiss was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2016\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\n\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t350.31 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t10/04/2016 \r\n\r\nFiles:\t31\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength : 02:03:31\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\n  CD1\r\n01 â€“ Creatures Of The Night\r\n02 â€“ All Hell's Breakin' Loose\r\n03 â€“ I've Had Enough (Into The Fire)\r\n04 â€“ Within\r\n05 â€“ Young And Wasted\r\n06 â€“ Heaven's On Fire\r\n07 â€“ Exciter\r\n08 â€“ Who Wants To Be Lonely\r\n09 â€“ Heart Of Chrome\r\n10 â€“ Not For The Innocent\r\n11 â€“ Killer\r\n12 â€“ Lick It Up\r\n13 â€“ Paralyzed\r\n14 â€“ And On The 8th Day\r\n15 â€“ Rock And Roll Hell\r\n\r\n  CD2\r\n01 â€“ King Of The Mountain\r\n02 â€“ War Machine\r\n03 â€“ Modern Day Delilah\r\n04 â€“ Long Way Down\r\n05 â€“ A Million To One\r\n06 â€“ Uh!
