So he joined the SEALs in order to become a sniper. After marrying, Kyle and the other members of the team are called for their first tour of Iraq. Kyle's struggle isn't with his missions, but about his relationship with the reality of the war and, once returned at home, how he manages to handle it with his urban life, his wife and kids. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e58d186fe1cfa519b08d6e387e16da1dcc8d5e","amp;dn":"American+Sniper+%282014%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e58d186fe1cfa519b08d6e387e16da1dcc8d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,229,141,24,111,225,207,165,25,176,141,110,56,126,22,218,29,204,141,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
