Version 4.0 suggests how to improve those audio files to make them \n  sound better for a live DJ performance\n- Ability to add custom keywords to each track for quick searching\n\n\n\nHow-To Guide for Harmonic Mixing \n \nHarmonic Mixing is an advanced technique used by top DJs all over the world. \nBy mixing tracks that are in the same or related keys, harmonic mixing enables \nlong blends and mash-ups. The goal is to eliminate key clashes.\n\nHarmonic mixing consists of two elements: knowing the key of every song that \nyou play and knowing which keys are compatible.\n\nTo get started, use Mixed In Key software to analyze your music. Launch the \nlatest Version 4.0, click &quot;Add Files&quot; and Mixed In Key will automatically \nscan your MP3 and WAV files.  It will detect the key and BPM of every song. \n\nHarmonic mixing helps you achieve a 'live mash-up' effect and encourages \ncreativity. You'll discover unusual song mixing combination's, like The Beatles \nvs. Jay-Z, or you can simply enjoy flawless DJ mixing, like Armin Van Buuren, \nPaul Van Dyk and Sasha.\n\nWith harmonic mixing, it's essential to know the key of every song you play. \nMixed In Key software scans your entire music collection (MP3s and WAVs) to \nmake this easy. When scanning is done, Mixed In Key displays your results in \nthe Camelot Easymix notation (e.g. 4A, 6B) or Flat/Sharp notation (e.g. F minor, \nB-flat minor). \n\nTo use harmonic mixing in your DJ sets, subtract one hour, add one hour, or stay \nin the same hour as your last song. If you're in key of 4A, your next song can be \n3A, 4A or 5A. You are simply subtracting or adding one hour.\nBy using this method, your mixes will be harmonic. Because it is based on music \ntheory, harmonic mixing works for all music genres.\n\n\n*The First Mix\nTo help DJs learn harmonic mixing Mark Davis created the Camelot wheel (see image),\na visual representation of which musical keys are compatible with each other.\nOn the Camelot wheel each musical key is assigned a keycode number from one \nto twelve, like hours on a clock.\n\nFor the first mix, we recommend mixing two songs that have the same keycode, like \n8A and 8A. This will sound like a professional mash-up made in the studio, even \nif you are mixing on live DJ equipment.\n\n\n*Create Interesting Mixes\nGet creative! You're in control. Using the Camelot method, you can move around \nthe Camelot wheel one step at a time. With every mix, you can change keys.\n\nFor a special effect, mix between the inner and the outer circle. \nTry this: Stay in the same hour, but change the letter. \nFor example, you can mix from 10B to 10A. If you are in 10A, your next song can be\n10B (change letter), 9A (subtract one hour), 10A (same hour), or 11A (add one hour).\n\n\n*Camelot Easymix method\nThe Camelot notation makes harmonic mixing easy. On the Camelot Easymix Wheel \n(see image) musical keys can be seen as hours on a clock. For example, 4 o'clock \ncorresponds to 4A or 4B. The A letter represents Minor keys. The B letter \nrepresents Major keys.\n\n\n*Moving Around The Wheel\nMost professional DJs move around the Camelot wheel with every mix. \n\nFor a perfect mix, choose a keycode within one &quot;hour&quot; of your current keycode.  \nIf you are in 8A, you can play 7A, 8A or 9A next. If you are in 12A, you can \nplay 11A, 12A or 1A. This mix will be smooth every time.\n\nYou can also mix between inner and outer wheels if you stay in the same &quot;hour.&quot;  \nFor example, try mixing from 8A to 8B, and notice the change in melody as you go \nfrom Minor to Major.\n\n\n*Approach to Harmonic Mixing\nWe recommend going clock-wise or counter-clockwise around the wheel, changing key \nevery couple of songs. For example, we may play: 10A &gt; 10A &gt; 10B &gt; 9B &gt; 8B &gt; 8A &gt; \n7A &gt; 6A for a 100% harmonic DJ set. It never gets boring because there is a music \nprogression happening during the entire mix. Your audience will love it as well. \nThis is the method used by top Mixed In Key DJs such as Pete Tong, Deep Dish \nand thousands of others.   \n\n\n*Summary\nScan your files with Mixed In Key Version 4.0. Use the Camelot Wheel to pick \ncompatible tunes. Mix them on your favorite DJ equipment. Result: Harmonic Mixing.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n- Windows XP/Vista\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mixedinkey.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mixedinkey.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\nAlso scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware \ndetected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at November, 18 2009 - 09.30 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.",
