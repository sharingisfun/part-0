As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to The Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for a global adventure.\n\nDirector: Joss Whedon\nWriters: Joss Whedon, Stan Lee (comic book)\nStars: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo\nGenres: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\n\n\nAvengers.Age.of.Ultron.2015.TCRip.XVID.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8\n\nSource: Mandarin 720P Telecine\nAudio: Line from MrSeen-Simple-Jiinx\nthx\n\nIf you want the perfect version here is your chance, it wont get better than this till retail\n\nNotes:\nlast but not least my version of that great movie, worked 5 days on it, wasnt funny at all, shouldnt have spend that much hours of work on a single movie,\nbut i wanted to do the perfect version the first time, without the need of a v2, proper, new source,new line, superhdts,hqhdts,readnfo or similar crap.\nhad the first video before the russian did, was nice nearly unmarked but mostly choppy, tried to fix that for hrs didnt get much better. \nthan the russian version came,slightly better but marked, tried to remove the marks looked odd, in the meanwhile another source with watermark right top corner\nwas around, couldnt be blurred without looking bad, also was more disturbing than the russian vid, also choppy so went to trashcan\n\nfinally the mandarin video came even with the endcreditscene, nearly free of watermarks, nothing choppy, technically perfect but\nthe first minute is a translucent logo in the middle of the screen, and a small translucent logo stays for 30mins at the lower right corner but its hardly visible (doesnt bother at all)\nthe chinese site logo appears 2 times in the movie noticeable for 30secs\nand the colouring was a mess all yellow-ish\n\nEncode:\ntook the mandarin video and tried to fix the colours the normal way, wasnt doable with a single setting. \nhad to try alternative ways outside vdub. altering one colour had immediate effect on the rest of the movie, was a pita, encoded for hours, wasnt happy\nonly thing that worked was doing everything manually, black base, white base, rgb,chroma,contrast,brightening,saturation,yuv, lumina\naltering a video that much took 12h just for the colours, temporary discspace around 1TB @720p but its totally worth it.\n\nas mentioned above the first minute the site watermark pops up, nearly not visible but its theire, its not blurrable, but it doesnt bother at all\nthat 2 spots where the watermark comes really visible for 30secs i had to blur cause i didnt like it.\n\nfor the Audio i had already fixed the first line release from MrSeen-Simple for hours, when the proper line release came, unfortunately not synced to the mandarin version\ninstead to the blurred version,which doesnt fit the slightest to the mandarin video i had already done.\nso i had to start from scratch again, line had hiss, left and right balance was still off but fixable, the 4min crackle spot at 1h27 or something was still theire.\nran it through my usual cleaning process, and lowered the noise for that 4 mins, cant be removed completely but its better now.\n\ndoing lipsync without having the original line was a pita, it was already stretched and cut to fit to the blurred choppy version\nand now i had to remove all that work to get it sync to the mandarin video again, it took hours, in the end all worked out perfectly\n\nsadly i did not get the original audio file, coulda saved me hours - maybe next time then\n\nanyways\nquality is great now, pretty similar to my iron man 3 release i would say,\nhave done the usual avi file and a 720p file for the Quality hunters.\n\ntotally worth watching, got very nice\n\nIf you want the perfect version here is your chance, it wont get better than this till retail\nenjoy\n\nVideo:720x336 @bitrate 1700 2pass\nAudio: English Stereo Line 2.0\nSample: yes included\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                  : Avengers.Age.of.Ultron.2015.TCRip.XVID.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8.avi\nFormat                         : AVI\nFormat/Info                    : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                      : 1.83 GiB\nDuration                       : 2h 13mn\nOverall bit rate               : 1 968 Kbps\nWriting application            : Nandub v1.0rc2\nWriting library                : Nandub build 1853/release\n\nVideo\nID                             : 0\nFormat                         : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                 : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP          : 2\nFormat settings, QPel          : Yes\nFormat settings, GMC           : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix        : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                    : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                       : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                  : XviD\nDuration                       : 2h 13mn\nBit rate                       : 1 700 Kbps\nWidth                          : 720 pixels\nHeight                         : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 2.143\nFrame rate                     : 30.000 fps\nColor space                    : YUV\nChroma subsampling             : 4:2:0\nBit depth                      : 8 bits\nScan type                      : Progressive\nCompression mode               : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)             : 0.234\nStream size                    : 1.58 GiB (86%)\nWriting library                : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                             : 1\nFormat                         : AC-3\nFormat/Info                    : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                 : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness    : Big\nCodec ID                       : 2000\nDuration                       : 2h 13mn\nBit rate mode                  : Constant\nBit rate                       : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                     : 2 channels\nChannel positions              : Front: L R\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                      : 16 bits\nCompression mode               : Lossy\nStream size                    : 244 MiB (13%)\nAlignment                      : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration           : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration   : 500 ms\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T75&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T75&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7D&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7F&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7F&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7H&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7H&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7k&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7k&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7o&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/T7o&lt;/a&gt;",
