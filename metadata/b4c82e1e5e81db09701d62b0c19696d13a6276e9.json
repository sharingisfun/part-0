Not long into the 2007 trial of programmer Hans Reiser, accused of murdering his wife, the defendant's friend Sean Sturgeon obliquely confessed to several murders (though not the murder of Reiser's wife). Elliott, caught up in the film-ready twist and his tenuous connection to Sturgeon (they share a BDSM social circle), makes a gonzo record of the proceedings. The result is a scattered, self-indulgent romp through the mind of a depressive narcissist obsessed with his insecurities and childhood traumas. \r\n\r\nDirector: Pamela Romanowsky\r\nWriters: Stephen Elliott (memoir), Pamela Romanowsky (screenplay)\r\nStars: Amber Heard, James Franco, Christian Slater\r\nGenres: Action | Drama | Thriller\r\nCountry: USA\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: True.Deception.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO\r\n                                             \r\nSOURCE: 720p - Thanks King-DVD!                                              \r\n\r\nViDEO: 2200 Kbps\r\n\r\nRESOLUTiON: 720x296\r\n\r\nRUNTiME: 1h 26m 43s \r\n\r\nSUBTiTLES: No                             \r\n\r\nAUDiO: 192 Kbps AC3 2.0       \r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\n SPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                 HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight, EMPEROR_DVD.   \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aE1O \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aE1S \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aE1q \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/aE1y","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4c82e1e5e81db09701d62b0c19696d13a6276e9","amp;dn":"True.Deception.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4c82e1e5e81db09701d62b0c19696d13a6276e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,200,46,30,94,129,219,9,112,29,98,176,193,150,150,209,58,98,118,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
