It is in ALAC format. I prefer ALAC to FLAC because of iTunes integration, but they are both lossless, so if you like FLAC it is very easy to convert, and you will lose no audio quality (XLD for Mac is free and does it quickly).\n\nLog and cue files are included.\n\nTracks:\n01 Cheap Beer\n02 Stoked and Broke\n03 White On White\n04 No Waves\n05 Whore\n06 Max Can't Surf\n07 Blackout Stout\n08 Wake Bake Skate\n09 Gimmie Something\n10 5 to 9\n11 LDA\n12 Paycheck\n13 Wait for the Man\n14 Cocaine\n\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62a462c98cf162f952e2632c6289aa8f41ad3b5f","amp;dn":"Fidlar+-+Fidlar+%28Self+Titled%29+2013+%5BALAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62a462c98cf162f952e2632c6289aa8f41ad3b5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,164,98,201,140,241,98,249,82,226,99,44,98,137,170,143,65,173,59,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
