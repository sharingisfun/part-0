  "description": "Onikira Demon Killer (c) Merge Games\n\n08/2015: RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION: Steam\n1: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: Action, Adventure\nIndie\n\nDeveloped by Irish-based indie, Digital Furnace Games, Onikira: Demon\nKiller is an awesome side-scrolling, 2D beat'em-up set in fantasy feudal\nJapan. As Yamazaki Jiro, a lone samurai, players battle to prevent the\nforces of the Japanese underworld, Yomi, from consuming the land of the\nliving\n\nOnikira: Demon Killer blends together complex deep fighting mechanics\nusually found in traditional 3D beat-em'ups, like Ninja Gaiden or Bayonetta\nand merges them with classic 2D platform-game mechanics. Onikira's\nexpressive fighting system enables players to engage in whichever way suits\nthem best. Some players will prefer to go toe-to toe with heavy weapons and\nmash buttons while others will opt for a ranged game style, avoiding heavy\nmelee encounters. Try launching an enemy into the air, wall jumping to\nposition yourself above them then Katana Slaming them into the ground\nSwitch weapons to the Naginata and use the Naginata Lift and air dash moves\nto stay in the air and off crumbling platforms, while pulling enemies up to\nyou to be dispatched in mid-air. Whip out your grappling hook to grapple\nbetween platforms, across chasms or fiery pits, all the while fending off\nenemies\n\nOnikira: Demon Killer boasts seven challenging areas and players can\nexpress themselves with over forty uber-cool moves, using four devastating\nweapons. Each level is littered with foul demons that players must dispatch\nback to the underworld and players must also face two mini-bosses and two\nepic mega bosses. Every level is crammed full of environmental aids to help\nthe player in combat encounters. Slice the support pillars off a building\nand watch it crush your enemies as it collapses, or use your moves to fling\nenemies into spikes, pits, or the path of moving deadly objects. Be careful\nthough, as dropping a building on your own head is known to cause sadness!\n\nUnique high-level combat Onikira mixes 2D platform game elements into the\ncombat system to make something special. Moving platforms, wall jumping\nwall running and grappling all serve to make for dynamic and emergent\ncombat encounters\n\nSeven Areas the narrative unfolds over highly polished and gorgeous\nhand-painted levels featuring rain drenched villages, destroyed opulent\ncities, mountaintop locations and an erupting volcano\n\nMaster unique weapons Each weapon - sword, tetsubo, naginata or arm blades\nhas multiple unlockable moves which can result in massive combo chains\nwhen moves are strung together. Combo chains turn directly into score\nmultipliers\n\nResponsive and Expressive Combat System players are rewarded for strategic\nand skill-based fighting. Play flows naturally from move to move, allowing\nthe player to create new combos that haven't been designed explicitly by\nthe developers\n\nSoul Shop souls are the currency of Onikira. Use them to revive your\nhealth and trade them. At certain points inside each level, the player will\nfind rifts into Yomi where benevolent spirits will trade moves for\ncollected souls\n\nChallenge Arenas players complete combat related challenges and improve\ntheir score and skill to gain achievements. The arenas are fully integrated\ninto Steam's online leaderboards\n\nSpecific enemy types with their own unique vulnerabilities, every enemy\nemphasises a particular fighting style, like a floating, possessed Mempo\nmask that encourages the use of air game or a monstrously twisted\nhigh-ranking samurai, where hit and run tactics are the best way to stay\nalive\n\n1.
