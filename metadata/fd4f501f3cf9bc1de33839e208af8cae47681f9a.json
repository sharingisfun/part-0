I'm back with a treat from the archives!\n\nTechnical:\n----------\nResolution: 1280x720 (HD 720p)\nVideo Codec: H.264\nAudio Codec: AAC\nContainer: MP4\n\nSamples:\n--------  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/album/JaAIpaaAc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/album/JaAIpaaAc&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEpisode Info:\n------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAJGiAaFd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nAJGiAaFd&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRuPaul's All Stars Drag Race is the All-Star season of RuPaul's Drag Race and premiered on the Logo network on October 22, 2012. Cast members were announced on August 6.\nThis season features twelve returning contestants representing all four seasons for a chance to be inducted into the &quot;Drag Race Hall of Fame&quot;. This series aired six hour-length episodes. Contestants were judged on their &quot;charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent&quot; and, since they competed in teams of two, also &quot;synergy&quot;. The winner received a supply of MAC cosmetics, a &quot;one of a kind trip&quot; and $100,000. The theme song playing during the runway every episode is &quot;Responsitranity&quot; (Matt Pop's Edit)\nThe first episode introduced several changes to the rules for the All Stars competition. Queens competed in teams of two, determined by the contestants themselves. Both members of the team would be eliminated. The bottom two teams chose one member to &quot;lip synch for their lives&quot;. The non-lip synching teammates had the option during the first minute of the performance to declare a &quot;she-mergency&quot;, hit a panic button and &quot;tag in&quot; to complete the performance.\n\nGreetings:\n----------\nSee ya'll in Season 6 xx fabutrash",
