  "description": "AndrÃƒÂ© Aleman, &quot;Our Ageing Brain: How Our Mental Capacities Develop as We Grow Older&quot;\n\nISBN: 1922247634, 192510611X | 2015 | EPUB, \n\n\nAn international bestseller delivering good news on brain function and ageing We all worry sometimes that our brains - particularly our memories - just don't work as well as they used to. In this illuminating book, internationally acclaimed Dutch neuroscientist Andre Aleman shows that although the decline in our mental capacities begins earlier than we think, this is not such a bad thing. In fact, older people are more resistant to the effects of stress, cope better with their emotions and with complex situations, and are - generally speaking - happier than their younger counterparts",
