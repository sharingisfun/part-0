About\n---------------------------\n\nSchool Mate 2 is marketed as a sequel to the School Mate game, both produced by the Japanese company ILLUSION and released for the PC on June 25, 2010. \n\nThis is an eroges game based on a story line devided into 19 chapters which, when succesfully finished, unlocks the free play mode. Doing a specific selection in free mode unlocks the final ending of the story, but continue to play in free mode will stay available. \n\nYukariko and the Hero (a classmate of Yukariko) are cleaning the 3 Jizou statues on the school ground when they slip trying to move the heavy stone. The head of one of the statues is broken and this awakens the 3 spirits, Suho, Asagi and Kohaku. \n\nThe spirits are able to take control of Yukariko's body and tell her that she has been cursed because of the damage done to the statue. Yukariko does not believe in the curse, but the spirits tell her that they will teach her to believe. Furthermore, Yukariko is told that the curse can only be lifted if she does what the spirits ask of her. \n\nThe hero does not entirely understand what is happening and the next day greets Yukariko normally. He is told to not speak to her anymore, and that she will send him keitai mail from now on. \n\nThe next day, he receives a mail which asks him to come meet her in the classroom after school. \n\nWhat do the spirits have planned for Yukariko now??? \n\n\n---------------------------\n2.
