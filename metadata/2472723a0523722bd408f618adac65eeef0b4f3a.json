The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer Sean Kinney, \n\nand bassist Mike Starr (who was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez).\n\nAlthough widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound \n\nincorporates heavy metal and acoustic elements. Since its formation, Alice \n\nin Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, \n\nfour compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinct vocal \n\nstyle which often included the harmonized vocals of Staley and Cantrell.\n\nAlice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement \n\nof the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl \n\nJam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts \n\nof the 1990s, selling over 25 million albums worldwide,[1] and over 14 \n\nmillion in the US alone.[2] In 1992 the band released their album Dirt \n\nwhich was critically acclaimed and has been certified quadruple platinum. \n\nThe band also achieved two No.1 Billboard 200 albums (Jar of Flies and \n\nAlice in Chains), 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, \n\nand eight Grammy Award nominations.\n\nAlthough never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by \n\nextended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, \n\nwhich resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 with new \n\nlead vocalist William DuVall, and released their fourth studio album, \n\nBlack Gives Way to Blue, in 2009. The album was a success, being certified \n\ngold by the RIAA in 2010. Alice in Chains released their fifth studio \n\nalbum, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, on May 28, 2013\n\nR.I.P. Layne Staley",
