  "description": "In 1993, Frank Miller returned to one of the characters he helped define in the 80's - Matt Murdock aka Daredevil, The Man Without Fear. This five-issue miniseries explored Murdock's origins - from his relationship with his father to the accident that forever changed him, and how he learned to cope with his new-found abilities in the wake of his father's murder. Miller's knowledge of the character, as well as strong art by both himself and John Romita Jr., contribute a great sense of mood to the story. Miller explore's Murdock's psyche in all phases of the tale, and his inner monologue serves to make him both a heroic and sympathetic character while still retaining a harder edge than, say, Spider-Man. This is still the definitive modern rendition of Dardevil's origin and has been used a blueprint by a number of later Daredevil writers - including notables such as Ed Brubaker, Kevin Smith, and Mark Waid. All issues here are Digital, thanks to Zone-Empire. Their work is much appreciated, and I hope you like this too - as always, please seed and enjoy! :-)",
