  "description": "\nGood Charlotte is a band from Waldorf, Maryland, United States that formed in 1996. They took the name Ã¢â‚¬ËœGood CharlotteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ from a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book: Good Charlotte: The Girls Of Good Day Orphanage by Carol Beach York. They have released five albums, most notably 2002Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s multiplatinum seller The Young and the Hopeless, which spawned the chart topping singles, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Anthem,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls &amp; Boys.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third album is 2004Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s The Chronicles of Life and Death, the fourth, released 2007, is called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good Morning RevivalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and their fifth and most recent release was released in 2011, titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“CardiologyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The band is fronted by twin brothers Benji and Joel Madden, born in Waldorf, Maryland. Other members of the band include their friends Billy Martin and Paul Thomas.\n\nGood CharlotteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frontmen, identical twins Joel and Benji Madden, were born on March 11, 1979 to a middle class family in Waldorf, Maryland. Their mother raised them with a strict, devout Catholic up-bringing. Their father left the family when the twins were 16 years old, causing financial problems for the twins, their mother, older brother, and younger sister. For a short period of time the twins had to work as shampoo boys in a salon. Benji and Joel cite their older brother Josh Madden for introducing them to rock music by bands such as The Beach Boys and Social Distortion. After attending a Beastie Boys concert at the age of 16, Benji and Joel decided to start their very own band, although Joel had never sung before, and Benji had never played guitar.\n\nAlbums:\n\n[2000] Good Charlotte (Self Titled)\n[2002] The Young and the Hopeless\n[2004] The Chronicles of Life and Death\n[2007] Good Morning Revival\n[2010] Cardiology",
