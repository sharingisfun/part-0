  "description": "&quot;Every album is a point in Rush's history,&quot; Geddy Lee said in 1978. &quot;And if it's not getting better, something's wrong. Every album has to be the perfect Rush album.&quot;\n\n&quot;The first record,&quot; Alex Lifeson says about 2112, &quot;where we sounded like Rush.&quot;\n\n&quot;2112 is, more than anything, a record about being Rush: loving music, moving it forward and taking it to the world, whatever the price. And it is perfect.&quot; David Fricke\n\nIn time for 21/12 celebrations, the DELUXE EDITIONS of Rush's 1976 platinum-selling, landmark album 2112\n\nThe deluxe editions contain a remastered 2112 CD with 3 live bonus tracks\n\nOriginally released in 1976, Rush s epic, landmark release 2112 was their creative and commercial breakthrough as well as one of the band's most highly regarded releases among both fans and critics alike. With lyrics written by Neil Peart, and influenced by author Ayn Rand, 2112 kicks off with the ambitious seven-suite title track (side one), set in a futuristic world run by the &quot;Priests of the Temples of Syrinx&quot; who regulate &quot;every single facet of every life,&quot; which includes books, music, work and play. &quot;2112&quot; conveys the story of humanity's instinctual, inner need for one's free will.\n\nAfter the mythological journey through &quot;2112,&quot; side two brings you back to the present and continues with five stand-alone tracks. From hard-rocking tracks such as &quot;A Passage to Bangkok,&quot; &quot;Lessons,&quot; and a trip to into the fourth dimension with &quot;The Twilight Zone,&quot; to the album's soaring conclusion, &quot;Something For Nothing,&quot; 2112 is the album that ushered in the next stage in their continuing evolution as artists.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. 2112\n2.
