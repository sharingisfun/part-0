  "description": "Guitar Hero III: The Ultimate Collection 2-Disc Set (PC)\n\nDisc 1: The Essentials\n- Game Installer\n- Patch v1.3\n- Crack v1.3\n- GHTCP v2.0.4.6\n- .NET Framework v4.0\n\nDisc 2: The Customs\n- 300 Songs Pack\n- World Tour Note Mod\n- Feedback Chart Editor\n- Plenty of other Extras!!\n\nInformation\nThis is hopefully the best Guitar Hero III collection available! Included is a pack of 300 custom songs and everything needed to play the game and even create your own customs. The customs included are an update to my old torrent here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6260290/Guitar_Hero_III_PC_Ultimate_Expert_Song_Pack\n\nFollow the instructions carefully with the &quot;View Help&quot; button from the disc menus. Installation of all the material is as simple as 1-2-3. If you plan to use GHTCP with the song pack make sure to run it first and create a backup before installing the songs. If you fail to do this, a backup is provided on Disc 2 in &quot;GHTCP Data&quot; folder. Simply copy it to the GHTCP installation folder.\n\nI hope you enjoy this! This download has absolutely no malicious software bundled with it. It is an honest attempt to try and bring the best GHIII experience possible to fun dying game! Almost all songs were re-edited to fit the &quot;GHIII Standard&quot; but there may be some I missed that have sync issues or other issues.\n\nLanguages other than English:\nEnglish users will only need to install the Song Pack, GHTCP is completely OPTIONAL. For other languages it is a REQUIREMENT. The song pack only updates the English files in the game. If you wish to play the customs in other versions then follow these instructions:\n\n01.) Install Game, install GHTCP, run it, and create a backup in your language. Do this BEFORE installing the Song Pack as I'm unsure if it will interfere.\n02.) Close GHTCP, install the Song Pack.\n03.) Open GHTCP, &quot;File &gt;&gt; Open Game Settings&quot;, choose your language.\n04.) Under &quot;Setlist Configuration&quot; tab, choose &quot;Bonus&quot;.\n05.) From menu &quot;Game Management &gt;&gt; SGH Setlist Switch&quot;.\n06.) Import Bonus.sgh from Disc 2 folder &quot;GHTCP Data&quot;.\n07.) It will ask to import all music and game tracks, hit NO. The data is already there from when you installed the Song Pack.\n08.) Do this for Quickplay and Download.\n09.) Create two new setlists named &quot;SongListA&quot; and &quot;SongListB&quot;.\n10.) Import these setlists as well from the &quot;GHTCP Data&quot; folder on Disc 2.\n11.) Go to &quot;File &gt;&gt; Execute Actions&quot; and play the game.\n\nHopefully that's everything, enjoy!",
