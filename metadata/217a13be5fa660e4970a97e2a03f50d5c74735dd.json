Although the group emerged in 1996 in Orlando, FL, singers JC Chasez and Justin Timberlake had previously co-starred on The Mickey Mouse Club before relocating to Nashville, where they worked on solo projects with the same vocal coach and songwriters. Timberlake soon returned to Orlando, where he befriended Chris Kirkpatrick and Joey Fatone. Along with Chasez, the four agreed to form a boy band, and *NSYNC officially launched after the addition of bass singer Lance Bass.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tJive\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Bye Bye Bye\n02.Girlfriend (The Neptunes Remix Featuring Nelly)\n03.This I Promise You (Radio Edit)\n04.It's Gonna Be Me\n05.God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You (Remix)\n06.I Want You Back (Radio Edit)\n07.Pop (Radio Version)\n08.Gone\n09.Tearin' Up My Heart (Original Radio Edit)\n10.Thinking Of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)\n11.I'll Never Stop (Radio Edit)\n12.Music Of My Heart\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:217a13be5fa660e4970a97e2a03f50d5c74735dd","amp;dn":"NSYNC+-+Greatest+Hits+%282005%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"217a13be5fa660e4970a97e2a03f50d5c74735dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,122,19,190,95,166,96,228,151,10,151,226,160,63,80,213,199,71,53,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
