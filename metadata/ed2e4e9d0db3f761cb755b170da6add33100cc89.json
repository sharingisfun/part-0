  "description": "Explosive Calisthenics: Superhuman Power, Maximum Speed and Agility, Plus Combat-Ready Reflexes--Using Bodyweight-Only Methods\nISBN: 0938045830 | 2015 | EPUB, PDF | 392 pages | 55 MB\n\nHow to Lead, Survive and Dominate PhysicallyÃ¢â‚¬â€By Becoming Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Complete PackageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ As an AthleteÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \nExplosive Calisthenics is for those who want to be winners and survivors in the game of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€for those who want to be the Complete Package: powerful, explosive, strong, agile, quick and resilient. Traditional martial arts have always understood this necessity of training the complete packageÃ¢â‚¬â€with explosive power at an absolute premium. And resilience is revered: the joints, tendons, muscles, organs and nervous system are ALL conditioned for maximum challenge. \nReally great athletes are invariably that way too: agile as all get-go, blinding speed, ungodly bursts of power, superhuman displays of strength, seemingly at willÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \nThe foundation and fundamentals center, first, around the building of power and speed. But Explosive Calisthenics does a masterful job of elucidating the skill-practices needed to safely prepare for and master the more ambitious moves. \nBut Explosive Calisthenics doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just inspire you with the dream of being the Complete Package. It gives you the complete blueprint, every detail and every progression you could possibly want and need to nail your dream and make it a reality. You, the Complete PackageÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all laid out for you, step by step \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The first physical attribute we lose as we age is our ability to generate power. Close behind is the loss of skilled, coordinated movement. The fix is never to lose these abilities in the first place! Paul WadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Explosive Calisthenics is the best program for developing power and skilled movement I have seen. Just as with his previous two books, the progressions are masterful with no fancy equipment needed. \nYou donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to achieve a full back flip or kip up to get HUGE benefit from mastering the early progressions. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter if you are a 20-year old looking to push your power and agility to new heights or approaching middle age, trying to slow the hands of time. Do yourself a favor and get this amazing work. This book will be the gold standard for developing bodyweight power, skill, and agility.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€CHRIS HARDY, D.O. MPH, CSCS, author, Strong Medicine \nDiscover The Ultimate Course for Developing Yourself As a Supreme Physical SpecimenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \nWith Explosive Calisthenics, Paul Wade challenges you to separate yourself from the herd of also-ran followersÃ¢â‚¬â€to become a leader, survivor and winner in the physical game of life. But he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just challenge and inspire you. He gives you the direct means, the secrets, the science, the wisdom, the blueprints, the proven methods and the progressionsÃ¢â‚¬â€that make success inevitable, when you supply your end in consistent, diligent, skillful application. \nNow a legendary international bestseller, Convict Conditioning can lay claim to be the Great Instigator when it comes to the resurgence of interest in bodyweight exercise mastery. \nAndÃ¢â‚¬â€while Convict Conditioning 2 cemented WadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position as the preeminent authority on bodyweight exerciseÃ¢â‚¬â€there is no doubt that his magisterial new accomplishment, Explosive Calisthenics is going to blow the doors off, all over again. \nWhat makes Explosive Calisthenics so excitingÃ¢â‚¬â€and so profound in its implications? \nSee, it goes back to the laws of brute survival. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not Ã¢â‚¬Å“Only the strongest shall surviveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. No, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Only the strongest, quickest, most agile, most powerful and most explosive shall survive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ To be a leader and dominator and survivor in the pack, you need to be the complete package...\nNowÃ¢â‚¬â€for those who have the balls and the will and the fortitude to take it onÃ¢â‚¬â€comes the next stage: Explosive Calisthenics",
