If you own the game, just do not apply the unlocker. So, this release is optimal for everybody and not only for those who do not own the game.\n\n\n=============\nInstructions:\n=============\n\n1. Mount or unrar the .iso and run the .exe file to install the game..\n2. Use the shortcuts the installer creates.\n3.
