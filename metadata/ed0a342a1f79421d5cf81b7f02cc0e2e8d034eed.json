It carried Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins to the last frontier of human imagination: the moon.\r\n\r\nRocket Men is the thrilling story of the moon mission, and it restores the mystery and majesty to an event that may have become too familiar for most people to realize what a stunning achievement it represented in planning, technology, and execution.\r\n\r\nThrough interviews, twenty-three thousand pages of NASA oral histories, and declassified CIA documents on the space race, Craig Nelson re-creates a vivid and detailed account of the Apollo 11 mission. From the quotidian to the scientific to the magical, readers are taken right into the cockpit with Aldrin and Armstrong and behind the scenes at Mission Control.\r\n\r\nRocket Men is the story of a twentieth-century pilgrimage; a voyage into the unknown motivated by politics, faith, science, and wonder that changed the course of history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed0a342a1f79421d5cf81b7f02cc0e2e8d034eed","amp;dn":"Rocket+Men%3A+First+Men+on+the+Moon+by+Craig+Nelson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed0a342a1f79421d5cf81b7f02cc0e2e8d034eed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,10,52,42,31,121,66,29,92,248,27,127,2,204,14,46,141,3,78,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
