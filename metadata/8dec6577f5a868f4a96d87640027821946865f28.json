It is the band's first studio double album, and therefore also their longest to date, with a total length of 92 minutes. It also marks the longest gap between studio releases in the group's career at five years, following 2010's The Final Frontier. The album's launch and its supporting tour were delayed to allow vocalist Bruce Dickinson time to recover from treatment which he received in early 2015 to remove a cancerous tumour.\n[code][img]http://i.ytimg.com/vi/CBDanCsgVkM/maxresdefault.jpg[/img][/code]\nThe album was produced by long-time Iron Maiden collaborator Kevin Shirley and recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris from September to December 2014, which they had previously used for 2000's Brave New World. The band wrote and immediately recorded many tracks in the studio, resulting in a spontaneous live feel. The first song to be released from the album, &quot;Speed of Light&quot;, was issued as a music video on 14 August, while simultaneously made available as a digital download and CD single exclusive to Best Buy. In addition to being their longest studio record, it also contains the band's longest song, &quot;Empire of the Clouds&quot;, at 18 minutes in length. While not a concept album, references to the soul and mortality are prominent, realised in the Maya-themed cover artwork, created by Mark Wilkinson.\n\nContents\n\n\nIron Maiden - The Book of Souls \n\nÃÂ¡ategory: Music\nYear: 2015\nStyle: Heavy Metal\nAdditional: NWOBHM\nCountry: United Kingdom\nFormat: 320 mp3\n\n\nFiles: 13\n\nDescription: \nLength / : 01:32:13\n\nTracks:\n\n01.
