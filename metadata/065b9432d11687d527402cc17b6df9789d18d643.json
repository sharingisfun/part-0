As investigative journalist Miles Upshur, explore Mount Massive Asylum and try to survive long enough to discover its terrible secret... if you dare.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nIn the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors wait inside Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the Ã¢â‚¬Å“research and charityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ until now.\n\nActing on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.\n\nOutlast is a true survival horror experience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all come from the human mind.\n\nFeatures:\n\nTrue Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to survive the horrors of the asylum, your only chance is to run... or hide\nImmersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying world to explore\nHide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with parkour-inspired platforming elements\nUnpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and from where - one of the asylumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terrifying inhabitants will finally catch up to them\nReal Horror: OutlastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s setting and characters are inspired by real asylums and cases of criminal insanity\n\nWarning:\n\nOutlast contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.\nPlease enjoy.\n\n\nAdditional info:\nWineskin 2.5.11. WS9Wine-1.7x-NoSyncPatch-DITM\nYou can choose your language in options.\nMBA 13'' mid 2011 running good, MacPro 5.1 too.\n\nKnown Issues:\n- If the game closes as soon as you try to launch it, try going into Wineskin &gt; Advanced and click 'browse' next to the EXE path. Go into your Outlast folder, then into Binaries &gt; Win32 and SELECT OLGame.exe and the game should launch fine!\n- Main menu mouse cursor seems to lag a little bit. In-game menu mouse cursors are fine and do not lag\n- Depending on your graphics settings, you may encounter some frame-drops, however the game still seems to certainly be fully playable.\n- If the game screen goes BLACK and the audio Cuts off after selecting new game, simply Install &quot;Update 3 - FTS&quot; which should solve the issue. To obtain the update, simply google for it (e.g. &quot;Outlast UPDATE 3 FTS&quot; and you will almost certainly find a download link within the first few pages of the google search.\n\nAuthors: DanIsTheMan, PortingTeam.",
