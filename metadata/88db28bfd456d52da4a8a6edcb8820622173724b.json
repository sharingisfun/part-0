  "description": "Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.3.1 v20.1.0 (x86/x64)\r\n\r\nCreate beautiful vector art. The industry-standard vector graphics app lets you create logos, icons, sketches, typography, and complex illustrations for print, web, interactive, video, and mobile. Itâ€™s Illustrator like youâ€™ve never seen it. See how the fastest Illustrator ever helps you go from first idea to finished artwork just like that.\r\n\r\nWhat's New in Illustrator CC (2015.3):\r\n\r\nBetter collaboration with libraries\r\nControl assets in read-only Creative Cloud Libraries so they can be used by team members, but not changed or deleted.\r\n\r\nUpdated Libraries panel\r\nFind the assets you need faster with a larger Libraries panel, new filtered search of Adobe Stock, and icons that make it easy to identify licensed Adobe Stock assets.\r\n\r\nWork more efficiently with Adobe Stock\r\nLicense Adobe Stock assets directly in Illustrator via the Libraries and Links panels. And when browsing assets on the Adobe Stock website, open assets directly in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nFast export of assets and artboards\r\nSelect individual assets from one or more artboards, or choose entire artboards, and click once to export them to multiple sizes, resolutions, and formats perfect for screen, web, and icon workflows.\r\n\r\nLive Shapes and Transform panel updates\r\nA consistent visual experience makes it easier to work with Live Shapes. Controls automatically hide as shapes are scaled to small sizes, and polygons maintain live characteristics after non-uniform scaling. Plus, shapes and paths can be reset to their original rotation in the Transform panel.\r\n\r\nShowcase your work with Adobe Portfolio\r\nNow when you use Portfolio to show off your Illustrator designs and artwork, you can create custom landing and contact pages to better connect with viewers.\r\n\r\nAdobe Experience Design CC (Preview) integration\r\nCopy and paste your Illustrator CC artwork directly into Adobe XD, the new all-in-one tool for designing and prototyping user experiences for websites and mobile apps.\r\n\r\nAnd so much more\r\nAlso includes: Ability to scroll through stroke width and text sizes in proper increments; guides that stay unlocked when hidden; ability to turn the Pen tool into the Direct Selection tool by pressing Cmd/Ctrl when drawing; and more.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n- Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64 processor\r\n- Microsoft Windows 7 with Service Pack 1, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10\r\n- 1 GB of RAM (3 GB recommended) for 32 bit; 2 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended) for 64 bit\r\n- 2 GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices)\r\n- 1024 x 768 display (1280 x 800 recommended)\r\nTo view Illustrator in HiDPI mode, your monitor must support a resolution of 1920 x 1080 or more.\r\n- OpenGL 4.x\r\n\r\nIllustrator CC 2015.3.1 Release Notes \nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/release-note/illustrator-cc-2015-3-1-20-1-0-release-notes.html",
