In\nsimple terms, ReCycle lets you do with sampled loops what you can do with beats\nprogrammed from individual drum sounds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like alter the tempo, or replace sounds\nand process them individually. A tool for quickly editing sampled parts,\nchopping up riffs, remixing and doing mash ups.\n\nHow is it done? ReCycle will analyze your groove and break it up into its\nrhythmic components. You are now in complete control and free to change the\ntempo or the pitch, without one affecting the other. And that's just scratching\nthe surface.\n\nThen what? Load the resulting REX2 file into your audio sequencer or software\nsampler and you can be the master of your grooves, once and for all.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nTo take full advantage of the program, you need an application that reads REX2\nfiles (such as Propellerhead Reason), a SoundFont compatible application, an\nAKAI sampler that supports .AKP files, Digidesign SampleCell, or a program that\nreads Mixman TRK files.\nWindows\n\n   PC with 300 MHz or faster Pentium compatible processor\n   512 MB of RAM or more\n   Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 (or later)\n   800 Ãƒâ€” 600 display (or better)\n   16-bit Windows compatible audio card, preferably with an ASIO or DirectX\ndriver\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Unistall any previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need\nto get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install the setup's...\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use the AiR keygen to Register.\n\n\n       Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it! Done.\n\n\n                  3Nj0Y!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2009ee886a90d0cc87b1f4f53eba0de6e0686da3","amp;dn":"Propellerhead+Recycle+v2.2.3+Full+WiN+-+UGET+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2009ee886a90d0cc87b1f4f53eba0de6e0686da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,9,238,136,106,144,208,204,135,177,244,245,62,186,13,230,224,104,109,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
