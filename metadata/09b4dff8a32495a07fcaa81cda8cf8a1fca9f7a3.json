  "description": "For more info visit : appzdam.net\n\nWhat is the system Mathematica? Almost any workflow involves computing results, and that is exactly what makes the system Mathematica - from building a website for trading by hedge funds, or the publication of technical textbooks to developing embedded image recognition algorithms or teaching calculus. Mathematica system is known as the most powerful in the world of computing application. But it is much more - it is the only development platform fully integrating computation into the workflow from start to finish, confidently holding you from the initial idea all the way to deployed individual and industrial solutions.\n\nFeatures :\n\n\nNew mathematical structure\nExtended support geometric areas\nImprovements for solutions of differential equations\nMachine Learning\nSemantic data\nMany improvements to the base language\nSupport geographic data and processing\nSpace-hour calculations\nStochastic processes\nAdvanced Visualization\nImprovements in imaging\nSupport for third-party devices\nSupport undo!\nAnd much more ...\n\nWhat's new :\n\nAdded operations for lists and associations, including automatic removal of elements using Nothing\nNew and updated methods for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning\nExtensive geometric computing enhancements for basic and mesh regions\nImage processing techniques for computational photography including tone mapping, exposure combination, and more\nNew volume and discrete data visualization functionality: SliceDensityPlot3D and ListStepPlot\nNew capabilities for text search and analysis\nAn international Alphabet, plus a full range of technical and other character sets and encodings\nExpanded cloud usage and deployment options for permissions control, scheduled tasks, data logging, and local objects\nAutomatic mail processing with MailReceiverFunction and MailResponseFunction\nSupport for more geometry and data file formats, with dramatically improved STL import / export and streamlined JSON\nNumerical solving of eigenvalues Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹and eigenfunctions for ODEs and PDEs\nTime series and statistics updates, including support for intensity measures in Histogram\nTranslated code captions to help non-English speakers understand Wolfram Language code\n\nSystem Requirements :\n\nWindows 8.1 | Windows 8 | Windows 7 | Windows Vista | Windows Server 2012 | Windows HPC Server 2008 | Windows Server 2008\nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or equivalent\nRAM: 2GB + recommended\nDisk space: 8.8 GB\nInternet Access: required to use free-form linguistic input and work with the data used to calculate the\n\nNotes :\n\nCopy the crack to the desktop and run a command prompt (cmd) .\nRun Mathematica 10\nSelect &quot;Other ways to activate&quot;\nSelect &quot;Manual Activation&quot;\nCopy / overwrite the resulting MathID and paste into the crack (Please enter MathID :)\nPress Enter &quot;\nCopy Activation key from keygens and paste in the special field Mathematica\nPassword Copy and paste from keygen in the special field Mathematica\nClick the &quot;Activate&quot;\nNote daw item &quot;License Agreement ...&quot; and click OK\n\nFAQ :\n\n1. It will work in 32 &amp; 64 bit systems ?\n\n- Yes,Work for both 32 &amp; 64 bit\n\n2. Is this multilanguage?\n\n- Yes\n\n3. Is this Activated?\n\n- Keygen Provided...just read notes or nfo/text file to know treatment procedure.\n\n4. My antivirus detect as virus?\n\n- Just disable it until process not complete because some of antivirus count keygen,crack,patch as false +ve.\nDon't worry all files safely checked by us",
