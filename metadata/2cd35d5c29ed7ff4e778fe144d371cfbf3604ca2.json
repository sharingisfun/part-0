The film is directed by James Marsh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ known for his documentary films such as the Oscar-winning Man On Wire Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and features stars Eddie Redmayne of Les Miserables and Felicity Jones of Amazing Spider Man 2. The film will be released in the USA this November and the rest of the world in December. The score album will be released this autumn through BackLot Records. The world premiere of The Theory of Everything was at Toronto International Film Festival last week. Here are some of the press reactions to the score:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“JÃƒÂ³hann JÃƒÂ³hanssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score is sublimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Screen Daily\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score is so beautifully written it left many around me in tears at the extra emotion it brought.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BBC\n\nThe standout among the tech credits has to be JÃƒÂ³hann JÃƒÂ³hannsson, whose gorgeous score brings an incredible emotional resonance to the picture. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ HitFix\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Criminally overlooked last year in the grand scheme of things for his work on Prisoners, the composer orchestrates his best score of his career.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Awards Circuit\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The effect is heightened by JÃƒÂ³hann JÃƒÂ³hannssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score, whose arpeggio-like repetitions and progressions at times evoke the compositions of Philip Glass, working in concert with Jinx GodfreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swiftly edited montages to lyrical and emotionally extravagant effect.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Variety",
