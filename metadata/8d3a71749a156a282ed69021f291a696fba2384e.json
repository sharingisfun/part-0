Our governments are corrupt and the opposing parties pointlessly similar. Our culture is filled with vacuity and pap, and we are told thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing we can do: &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the way things are.&quot;\n\nIn this audiobook, Russell Brand hilariously lacerates the straw men and paper tigers of our conformist times and presents, with the help of experts as diverse as Thomas Piketty and George Orwell, a vision for a fairer, sexier society that's fun and inclusive.\n\nYou have been lied to, told there's no alternative, no choice, and that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deserve any better. Brand destroys this illusory facade as amusingly and deftly as he annihilates Morning Joe anchors, Fox News fascists, and BBC stalwarts.\n\nThis audiobook makes revolution not only possible but inevitable and fun",
