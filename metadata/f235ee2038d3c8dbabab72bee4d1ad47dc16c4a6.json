It is a controversial technology, and some law enforcement officers believe it is leading to 'risk-free crime' on the 'dark web' - a place where almost anything can be bought, from guns and drugs to credit card details.\n\nFeaturing interviews with the inventor of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and the co-founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, Horizon delves inside the 'dark web'.\n\n---\n\nFeatures contributions from: Alex Hawkinson, Joss Wright, Tim Berners-Lee, Julia Angwin, Julian Assange, Jacob Appelbaum, Bruce Schneier, David Chaum, Paul Syverson, Jon Iadonisi, Thomas Olofsson, Peter Todd, Troels Oerting, Eugene Kaspersky, Steve Crocker and Rick Lamb.\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND SHARE.
