So if it sounds like a collection of old outtakes at times, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the point. And if it has more in common with the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s post-Syd Barrett, pre-superstardom records than the mid-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s epics that turned on millions of headphones-wielding fans, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sorta the point, too.\n\nThe Endless River sounds like it was made by a band in transition. And in a way, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty much what Pink Floyd are these days, with only singer-guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason left. Wright plays on these tracks, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost an ethereal spirit here, drifting above, below and alongside the songs with ghostly detachment. He gives Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Endless RiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ its familiar qualities, but he also gives it some purpose and some of its aimlessness.\n\n\n\nAs such, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go into the album expecting Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Dark Side of the Moon,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœWish You Were HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or even Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Division Bell.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Endless RiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is subtler, and less inviting, than that. This is not an album of songs so much as it is a collection of ambient music pieces, sculpted together from leftover fragments of a 20-year-old album that, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face it, is no classic.\n\n\n\nBut tracks like the opening Ã¢â‚¬ËœThings Left Unsaid,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s What We DoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (whose synth and rhythm passages echo Ã¢â‚¬ËœWelcome to the MachineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAllons-Y (2),Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which features a signature searing Gilmour guitar solo, remind fans that, before they became one of the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest rock bands, Pink Floyd were scoring long, complex instrumental pieces for people to trip out to.\n\n\n\nMany of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Endless RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½s 18 cuts are stitched together so that it all flows together as a 53-minute instrumental suite with separate sections. Unfortunately, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always come together seamlessly. The sweeping Ã¢â‚¬ËœAnisina,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a highlight, gives way to Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Lost Art of Conversation,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a short, snoozy piano-based track that leads a string of similar, less-than-two-minute songs that were most likely unfinished studio fragments in their original forms. And the plodding Ã¢â‚¬ËœTalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ HawkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which includes a sampled 1994 commercial with physicist Stephen Hawking (and is a sorta sequel to Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Division BellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½s Ã¢â‚¬ËœKeep TalkingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), is more novelty than a fully formed number.\n\n\n\nSo when GilmourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice cuts through the clutter on  Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Louder Than Words,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the closing track and the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only song with a lead vocal, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a memory from the past, reminding us that Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Endless RiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a Pink Floyd album.\n\n\n\nBut the thing is, it really isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like a remix record of previously unreleased songs that just happened to be assembled by the artists who made the music. It may not be the final LP fans want from one of classic rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved bands, but as a closing-chapter tribute to both their late bandmate and lasting legacy, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kinda fitting.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]",
