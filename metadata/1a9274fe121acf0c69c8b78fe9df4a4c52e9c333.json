  "description": "NEW A more connected Photoshop - PhotoshopÃ‚Â® CC is part of Creative CloudÃ¢â€žÂ¢. That means you have access to all the latest updates and future releases the moment they're available. You can use Sync Settings and Save to Cloud to keep your settings and files organized across multiple computers. And with BehanceÃ‚Â® integration, you can share your projects straight from Photoshop CC and get immediate feedback from creatives around the world.\n\nNEW All-new Smart Sharpen - Rich textures, crisp edges, and distinct details. All-new Smart Sharpen is the most advanced sharpening technology available today. It analyzes images to maximize clarity and minimize noise and halos, and it lets you fine-tune for high-quality, natural-looking results.\n\nNEW Intelligent upsampling - Enlarge a low-res image so it looks great in print, or start with a larger image and blow it up to poster or billboard size. New upsampling preserves detail and sharpness without introducing noise.\n\nNEW Extended features included - As part of Creative Cloud, Photoshop gives you all the powerful image and video editing features you've come to expect - and it includes the advanced 3D editing and image analysis tools that were previously in Photoshop Extended.\n\nNEW Camera Raw 8 and layer support - Apply Camera Raw edits as a filter to any layer or file inside Photoshop, and then enhance them any way you want. And with new AdobeÃ‚Â® Camera Raw 8, you get more precise ways to heal images, fix perspective distortions, and create vignettes.\n\nNEW Editable rounded rectangles - One of your most requested features is here. Now you can resize shapes, edit them, and re-edit them - before or after they're created. Even edit individual corner radiuses in rounded rectangles. If a shape is bound for the web, export CSS data from the file to save time.\n\nNEW Multi-shape and path selection - Get more done in fewer clicks by selecting multiple paths, shapes, and vector masks at once. Even in multilayered documents with lots of paths, you can easily target the path (and any layer) you want right on canvas using a new filter mode.\n\nNEW Camera Shake Reduction - Save shots you thought were lost due to camera motion. Whether your blur was caused by slow shutter speed or a long focal length, Camera Shake Reduction analyzes its trajectory and helps restore sharpness.\n\nNEW Expanded Smart Object support - Apply Blur Gallery and liquify effects nondestructively thanks to Smart Object support. Your original file stays intact as you add blur effects or push, pull, pucker, or bloat the image or video. Edit or remove the effects at any time Ã¢â‚¬â€ even after saving your file.\n\nNEW Improved 3D painting - Live previews are now up to 100x faster and more responsive when you paint on 3D objects and texture maps. With the powerful Photoshop painting engine, you can make any 3D model look terrific.\n\nNEW Improved type styles - You spend hours getting text to look just right. Type styles let you save your formatting as a preset that you can then apply with just a click. You can even define type styles to use across all your Photoshop documents.\n\nNEW Copying of CSS attributes - When you hand-code a web design, you can't always get elements like rounded corners and colors to match your original. Now, let Photoshop generate CSS code for specific design elements, and simply copy and paste the code into your web editor to get the results you want.\n\nNEW Conditional Actions - Put routine processing jobs on autopilot with Conditional Actions. These commands use if/then statements to automatically choose between different actions based on rules you set up.\n\nNEW Improved 3D Scene panel - Make a smoother transition from 2D to 3D editing with a 3D Scene panel that has many of the options you already know from the Layers panel, like Duplicate, Instance, Groups, and Delete.\n\nNEW Workflow time-savers - Save time on common tasks, thanks to small but frequently requested features from users like you. Create paths more easily with new modifier keys, move a path with the spacebar, include ICC profiles in PNG formats, and more.\n\nNEW Improved 3D effects - Shadows and reflections can make or break your 3D artwork, and higher quality live previews help you get great looks faster. Plus, easily create better glow effects, scene illumination, and lighting for bumps and textures.\n\nNEW Color import from web files - Import color swatches directly from HTML, CSS, or SVG files Ã¢â‚¬â€ for inspiration, or to easily match the color schemes of existing web content.\n\nNEW System anti-aliasing for type - Get a realistic preview of how your type will look on the web with an option that closely matches the anti-aliasing of your Mac or WindowsÃ‚Â® system.\n\nContent-Aware technologies - Retouch images with incredible control and precision - and virtually no effort. Select an image object that you want to remove, rescale, or reposition, and Content-Aware technology fills, patches, extends, or recomposes your image for you.\n\nMercury Graphics Engine - Click, drag, and see your changes happen immediately - even on your largest image files. The Adobe Mercury Graphics Engine gives you unparalleled responsiveness in key tools like Liquify and Puppet Warp, so you can edit fluidly with near-instant results.\n\nPowerful tools for design - Design in Photoshop with a toolset that makes it easy to create for any medium. Use type styles, editable shapes, vector layers that let you apply strokes and gradients to vector objects, tools for quickly creating custom strokes and dashed lines, and more.\n\nIntuitive video creation - Bring your Photoshop editing skills to your video footage. Make any clip look better using the full range of familiar Photoshop tools, and create movies with an easy-to-use set of video tools. When you're ready to do more advanced work, edit with Adobe PremiereÃ‚Â® Pro.\n\nBlur Gallery - Add photographic blurs using simple, on-canvas controls. Create tilt-shift effects, blur everything and then sharpen one focal point, or vary blurriness between points. The Mercury Graphics Engine gives you immediate results, and with Smart Object support your blurs are nondestructive.\n\nIntuitive 3D tools and DICOM support - Get advanced features for 3D editing and medical imaging. Dive into 3D with an interface that gives you in-context and on-canvas controls, and easily analyze and work with DICOM files.\n\nBackground save and auto-recovery - Now you can keep working even while saving the largest of Photoshop files in the background. And let the auto-recovery option preserve your edits without interrupting your progress.\n\nNEW Improved Min and Max filters - Create more precise masks and selections with more powerful Minimum and Maximum filters, which now include options to preserve squareness or roundness.\n\nSystem requirements\n\n- IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â® 4 or AMD AthlonÃ‚Â® 64 processor (2GHz or faster)\n- MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® 7 with Service Pack 1 or Windows 8 (32 and 64 bit)\n- 1GB of RAM\n- 2.5GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices)\n- 1024x768 display (1280x800 recommended) with OpenGLÃ‚Â® 2.0, 16-bit color, and 512MB of VRAM (1GB recommended)*\n- Internet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, membership validation, and access to online services.\n\nLanguages : English, French, Turkish, Russian, Hungarian, Polish, Ukrainian, Czech\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html&lt;/a&gt;",
