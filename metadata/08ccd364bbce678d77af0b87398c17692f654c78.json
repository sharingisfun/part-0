It is commonly used to determine \na computer's performance with a game, as well as record gaming footage. \n\nThe program is very popular in the making of amateur machinima films.\nFraps can take screenshots in various formats: BMP, TGA, JPEG, and PNG. \n(However, only the BMP format is available in the freeware version.) \n\nIn its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as:\n- Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video while \n  playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima revolution! Throw away \n  the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never been this easy! \n  Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560x1600 with custom frame rates from \n  10 to 100 frames per second! \n- Benchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting \n  in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame \n  rate between any two points. Save the statistics out to disk and use them for \n  your own reviews and applications.\n- Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key! \n  There's no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot. \n  Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped.\n\nThe lossless Fraps codec allows decoding of Fraps-encoded videos (using a media \nplayer capable of decoding the AVI container format) or transcoding to other \nvideo formats (with the use of the right software). The Fraps video codec manages \nto capture videos with minimal impact on game performance, as it has been \noptimized to achieve compression higher than uncompressed RGB, resulting in \nsmaller filesizes, though the lossless format is considerably less space-efficient \nthan more heavily compressed lossy video formats such as DivX. This is because \nencoding on-the-fly to a high-compression format such as DivX would have a large \nnegative impact on game performance (as of 2007) and only a very fast hard drive \ncould record the immense amount of data produced in using uncompressed video. \nThe Fraps format is a compromise of the two.\n\nFraps 3 - New features and a new look!  \n- Fraps is now compatible with Windows 7 and the latest DirectX 11 games.\n- Ventrilo &amp; TeamSpeak users have long wanted a way to record their microphone \n  and speakers at the same time.  \n- For Windows 7 and Vista we've added realtime sound mixing to our video recording \n  so you can now capture both sides of the conversation!\n\nNVIDIA have recently included stereoscopic 3D support directly into their drivers. \nIf you play your DirectX9 (D3D9) game with 3D Vision enabled you can use Fraps to\nrecord the game in full 3D too!  You'll get a side-by-side stereo AVI recording \nthat you can drop straight in to a stereoscopic 3D player!\n\nFinally, we are aware that more and more people are putting Fraps to professional \nuse. We've added a new option to force lossless RGB compression to ensure that you \nalways have the highest quality video output to work with.\n\n\nChanges in Fraps 3.4.0 - 29th Mar 2011:\n***************************************\n- Added configurable buffer size for loop recording mode.\n- Increased video capture performance at high resolutions.\n- Fixed slow recording of Minecraft at default window size.\n- Fixed benchmark crashing when configured to stop automatically after 1 second.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n********************\n- DirectX 9.0c or DirectX 10\n- Requires Administrator rights\n- Supports all modern CPU's (Pentium 3 and above)\n- Captures fastest with an NVIDIA GeForce or ATI Radeon graphics card\n- Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista and Windows 7\n\n\nMore info:\n********** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fraps.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fraps.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*** When using TPB please read these important notes: \n*****************************************************\n\n01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.\n\n15. No Promises ... No Debts!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor requests: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=31&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=31&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1. Norton Internet Security \n2. Avira AntiVir Premium \n3. avast! Pro Antivirus\n4. Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.\nMalware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at April 02, 2011 - 09.00 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ccd364bbce678d77af0b87398c17692f654c78","amp;dn":"Fraps+v3.4.0+%28Full+Registered+Version%29+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ccd364bbce678d77af0b87398c17692f654c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,204,211,100,187,206,103,141,119,175,11,135,57,140,23,105,47,101,76,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
