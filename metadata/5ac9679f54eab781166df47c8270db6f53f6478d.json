Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac9679f54eab781166df47c8270db6f53f6478d","amp;dn":"The+Forest+v0.08+%282014%29%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac9679f54eab781166df47c8270db6f53f6478d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,201,103,159,84,234,183,129,22,109,244,124,130,112,219,111,83,246,71,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
