I also took the liberty of adding substantial punctuation (e.g. periods) to the .srt since it was missing them, which was rather aggravating. I also ran across a better translation of Brice Parain's conversation with Nana in the cafe and have thus replaced the original conversation in the subtitle file with that.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad8abe8d8fcd66699e8d8bdbca15f1cf32a7ee1","amp;dn":"Vivre+Sa+Vie+%28Jean-Luc+Godard%2C+1962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ad8abe8d8fcd66699e8d8bdbca15f1cf32a7ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,216,171,232,216,252,214,102,153,232,216,189,188,161,95,28,243,42,126,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
