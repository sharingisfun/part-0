Norton | September 1968 | LCCC: 66-18071 | DJVU/PDF | 649 pages | 7.33/20.7 mb\r\nPDF conversion is mine.\r\n\r\nTaking only the most elementary knowledge for granted, Lancelot Hogben leads readers of this famous book through the whole course from simple arithmetic to calculus. His illuminating explanation is addressed to the person who wants to understand the place of mathematics in modern civilization but who has been intimidated by its supposed difficulty. Mathematics is the language of size, shape, and orderâ€”a language Hogben shows one can both master and enjoy.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nLancelot Hogben was born in Southsea, Hampshire, England, in 1895 and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge University, where he obtained his M.S. degree. he received his D.Sc. degree from London Unversity and an honorary LL.D. from Birmingham Univesity. His other popular books include Science for the Citizen and (with Frederick Bodmer) The Loom of Language. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPROLOGUE 9\r\n1 MATHEMATICS IN REMOTE ANTIQUITY 33\r\n2 THE GRAMMAR OF SIZE, ORDER, AND SHAPE 75\r\n3 EUCLID AS A SPRINGBOARD 118\r\n4 NUMBER LORE IN ANTIQUITY 167\r\n5 THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE ALEXANDRIAN CULTURE 205\r\n6 THE DAWN OF NOTHING 243\r\n7 MATHEMATICS FOR THE MARINER 294\r\n8 THE GEOMETRY OF MOTION 343\r\n9 LOGARITHMS AND THE SEARCH FOR SERIES 402\r\n10 THE CALCULUS OF NEWTON AND LEIBNITZ 454\r\n11 THE ALGEBRA OF THE CHESSBOARD 521\r\n12 THE ALGEBRA OF CHOICE AND CHANCE 551\r\nTABLES 616\r\nANSWERS TO SOME OF THE\r\nEXERCISES 634\r\nINDEX 639\r\n \nhttps://s31.postimg.org/5bqt3rmtn/Mathematics_for_the_Million.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a56c2458942723aa94f2ba6dad91aa7fb2657d","amp;dn":"Mathematics+for+the+Million+-+How+to+Master+the+Magic+of+Numbers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a56c2458942723aa94f2ba6dad91aa7fb2657d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,165,108,36,88,148,39,35,170,148,242,186,109,173,145,170,127,178,101,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
