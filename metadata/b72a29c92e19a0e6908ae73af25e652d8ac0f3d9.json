  "description": "Hello!\n\nThese episodes of the HBO Show, Sex and the City, are formatted for your iPod, iPhone, PSP, Zune, etc.  This file contains ALL EPISODES from Seasons 1-6, plus some deleted scenes and alternate endings contained within Season 6.  I've tested these out on my iPod, and they all work just fine - the video and audio work fine (at least for me)! \n\nThere are 110 video files included.  These were all converted by myself using a program called &quot;WinAVI iPOD/PSP/3GP/MP4 Video Converter.&quot;  I converted these all myself from the original avi files on the pirate bay (thanks to the original uploader).  \n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex and the City is an American cable television series. The original run of the show was broadcast on HBO from 1998 until 2004, for a total of six seasons.\n\nSet in New York City, the show focused on four women, three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties. The quirky drama/comedy had multiple continuing story lines and tackled socially relevant issues such as sexually transmitted diseases, safe sex, heartbreaks, multiple partners, and promiscuity. It specifically examined the lives of big-city professional women in the late 1990s and how changing roles and expectations for women affected the characters.\n\nThe show was primarily filmed at New York City's Silvercup Studios and on location in and around Manhattan. Since it ended, the show has been aired in syndication on networks such as TBS, WGN, and many other local stations. However, basic cable outlets excise certain explicit show content that was broadcast in the original version.\n\n\n[edit] Episodes\n\n[edit] Season 1: 1998\nOrder Title Director Writer Original Airdate Code \n01 &quot;Sex and the City&quot; Susan Seidelman Darren Star June 6, 1998 101 \nAt a birthday party for thirty-something Miranda, Carrie and her friends vow to stop worrying about finding the perfect male and start having sex like men.
