  "description": "Description:\nConnectify Hotspot PRO is an easy to use software router for your Windows computer that lets you transform your laptop into a Wi-Fi hotspot so you can share a single Internet connection - such as wired ethernet, a 3 or 4G card or adapter, even another Wi-Fi network - with your friends, co-workers, and mobile devices. With Connectify Hotspot PRO, you can turn your Windows computer into a real Wi-Fi hotspot that shares that single 3G/4G connection with any other Wi-Fi enabled devices. You'll maximize the value of your 3G/4G card and get all your peripherals online at the same time!\n\nOn the Road, For the modern traveler, Internet connectivity is a lifeline. Airports, Hotels, and Coffee Shops know this and charge accordingly for Wi-Fi access or only supply you with an ethernet jack, which leaves Wi-Fi only devices and smart phones in the dark. With Connectify Hotspot PRO as your software-only travel router, you can connect to ANY available Internet connection (including 3G, 4G, and mobile broadband), start a hotspot, and get all of your devices online simultaneously, and at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Unlimited Hotspot Uptime Ã¢â‚¬â€œ No time restrictions, run your Connectify Hotspot 24/7.\n- Share Wi-Fi from 3G/4G Networks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Connectify Hotspot PRO supports sharing Internet from 3G/4G cards in addition to a wide variety of other USB cards and dongles. Turn your 3G or 4G USB stick into a real travel router.\n- Fully Customizable SSID Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Name your hotspot whatever you want! (Hotspot Lite requires your hotspot name to start with 'Connectify-').\n- Wi-Fi Extender Mode Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Extend the range of your home or office Wi-Fi with just a few clicks.\n- Drag &amp; Drop File Transfers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Easily share files of any size, directly to both devices connected to your hotspot, and to other Connectify Hotspot users on the same network.\n- AutoInternet Selection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Automatically configure your hotspot's Internet sharing settings.\n- Dispatch Integration - Share your Super-Fast Dispatch Connection with Connectify Hotspot PRO.\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 8.0.0.30686:\nHotspot:\n-Fix Android clients not being able to connect when Local Access is disabled.\n-Option to Ã¢â‚¬ËœDisable Adapter Power ManagementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Under Settings/Advanced) on the Hotspot adapter.
