  "description": "POSTAL 3 Retail English version [This version is already cracked so you dont need to crack the game, just follow the install notes and enjoy the game] This is a direct play version so thats the reason its 10GB, no need for installation)\n\nIn Postal III, The Postal Dude emigrates to Paradise's sister town of Catharsis as he previously blew up Paradise with a nuclear bomb.[6] Due to the economic meltdown, the Dude drives into town and becomes stranded by the fact he can not even afford a tank of gas. He then must find work and do various odd jobs to escape the town.\n\nThrough the course of the game the player can chose one of two paths, the &quot;bad path&quot; which includes joining in on the schemes of Mayor Chomo and Uncle Dave, or the &quot;good path &quot; which involves the Dude joining the Catharsis Police force. The game will take place in a fairly linear and cinematic way, although the players actions will affect the outcome of the story and the game. Although the &quot;good path &quot; will be more difficult to play, it will offer more story line and a longer campaign.\n\nMinimum\n\nSupported OS: Windows7 / Vista / Vista64 / XP\nProcessor: Pentium 4 3.0GHz\nMemory: 2 GB for XP / 4GB for Vista Win 7\nGraphics: DirectX 9 compatible video card with 128 MB, Shader model ATI X800, NVidia 6600 or better\nHard Drive: At least 16 GB of free space\nSound Card: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card, keyboard, mouse\n\nRecommended\n\nSupported OS: Windows 7 / Vista / Vista64 / XP\nProcessor: core 2 duo 2.4GHz\nMemory: 2 GB for XP / 4GB for Vista Win 7\nGraphics: DirectX 9 compatible video card with Shader model 3.0.
