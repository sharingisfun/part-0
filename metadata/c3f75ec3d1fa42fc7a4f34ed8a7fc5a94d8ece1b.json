  "description": "\nBarbara Oakley, &quot;A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)&quot;\nISBN: 039916524X | 2014 | EPUB | 336 pages | 9 MB\n\nWhether you are a student struggling to fulfill a math or science requirement, or you are embarking on a career change that requires a higher level of math competency, A Mind for Numbers offers the tools you need to get a better grasp of that intimidating but inescapable field. Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her optionsÃ¢â‚¬â€both to rise in the military and to explore other careersÃ¢â‚¬â€she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.\n",
