  "description": "Please seed!\n\nThe Sound of Music\nRodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music is a 1965 American musical film directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. The film is based on the Broadway musical The Sound of Music, with songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, and with the musical book written by the writing team of Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay.\nThe musical originated with the book The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp. It contains many popular songs, including &quot;Edelweiss&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, &quot;Climb Ev'ry Mountain&quot;, &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, &quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen&quot;, and &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot;, as well as the title song.\nThe movie version was filmed on location in Salzburg, Austria and Bavaria in Southern Germany, and also at the 20th Century Fox Studios in California. It was photographed in 70mm Todd-AO by Ted D. McCord. It won a total of five Academy Awards including Best Picture in 1965 and is one of the most popular musicals ever produced. The cast album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\nAdjusted for inflation, it made $1.046 billion domestically (at 2010 prices), putting it third on the list of all-time inflation-adjusted box office hits, behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars.[3] In 2001, The United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast\n\nJulie Andrews ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Maria von Trapp\tChristopher Plummer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Captain Georg von Trapp\n \nRichard Haydn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Max Detweiler\tEleanor Parker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Baroness Elsa Schraeder\n \nCharmian Carr ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Liesl von Trapp\tNicholas Hammond ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fredrich von Trapp\n\nHeather Menzies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Louisa von Trapp\tDuane Chase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Kurt von Trapp\n\nAngela Cartwright ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brigitta von Trapp\n\nDebbie Turner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Marta von Trapp     Kym Karath ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gretl von Trapp\t\n\nPeggy Wood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mother Abbess          Daniel Truhitte ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rolfe \n\n\nVarious Artists - The Sound Of Music (Original Soundtrack)\nRCA 2000, \noriginally released 1965\n\n01  Maria - Prelude And The Sound Of Music\n02  Orchestra and Nuns Chorus - Overture and Preludium (Dixit Dominus)\n03  Nuns Chorus - Morning Hymn and Alleluia\n04  Nuns Chorus - Maria\n05  Maria - I Have Confidence\n06  Rolf and Liesl - Sixteen Going on Seventeen\n07  Maria - My Favorite Things\n08  Maria and the Children - Do-Re-Mi\n09  The Children and the Captain - The Sound of Music\n10  Maria and the Children - The Lonely Goatherd\n11  The Children - So Long, Farewell\n12  Mother Abbess - Climb Ev'ry Mountain\n13  Maria and the Captain - Something Good\n14  Organ, Orchestra and Nuns Chorus - Processional and Maria\n15  The Captain, Maria, the Children and Chorus - Edelweiss\n16  Chorus and Orchestra - Climb Ev'ry Moutain (Reprise)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-sound-of-music-original-soundtrack-r128703&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-sound-of-music-original-soundtrack-r128703&lt;/a&gt;\n",
