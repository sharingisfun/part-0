Crack [TechTools]\nVirtualDJ is a DJ software for PC and MAC, which is used by DJs to replace their turntables and CD players, and use digital music instead of vinyl and CDs. It features a breakthrough BeatLock engine that will keep your songs in tune and let you work your mixes incredibly faster than any other DJ. VirtualDJ will let you mix and scratch music videos right from your turntables. The software is compatible with timecoded vinyls that let you scratch your MP3s directly on a real turntable, and with many other DJ equipment. Add to that the infinite number of cue points a DJ can save for each song and large collection of wonderful automatically beat-synchronized effects. You can use several interfaces to suit both beginners and professionals, record your mixes and burn them on CD, rip DVD, rip vinyl, create your own Internet radio, automatically mix playlists, use VST effects, display karaoke, and play DRMed file!\n\n\n\nThe automatic seamless loop engine and synchronized sampler lets the DJ perform astounding remixes live, with no preparation at all. The visual representation and the cues allow a DJ to clearly see the song structure, and never be surprised by a break.
