  "description": "Developer Productivity Tool for Microsoft Visual Studio.\n\nReSharper is a renowned productivity tool that makes Microsoft Visual Studio a much better IDE. Thousands of .NET developers worldwide wonder how theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever lived without ReSharperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s code inspections, automated code refactorings, blazing fast navigation, and coding assistance.\n\nJetBrains - Don't be mad at me. Some of us do not work with companies who buy them the tools they need - some of us are simply home developers who can't pay for Adobe, Microsoft and the rest of the companies that rule the world.\nI'm sure that your market resides in the bigger companies. \nAfter all which of you JB's didn't pirate windows when he was younger - please stand up. No one standing? So, you see.. you need to give some to get some - you took and now you give back. Nightly Builds is good solution - but don't set a time limit on it!\n\n",
