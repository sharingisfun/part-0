Jung's approach to psychology has been influential in the field of depth psychology and in countercultural movements across the globe. Jung is considered as the first modern psychologist to state that the human psyche is &quot;by nature religious&quot; and to explore it in depth. He emphasized understanding the psyche through exploring the worlds of dreams, art, mythology, religion and philosophy. Though not the first to analyze dreams, he has become perhaps the most well known pioneer in the field of dream analysis. Although he was a theoretical psychologist and practicing clinician, much of his life's work was spent exploring other areas, including Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, sociology, as well as literature and the arts.\n\nJung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern people rely too heavily on natural science and logical positivism and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of unconscious realms. He considered the process of individuation necessary for a person to become whole. This is a psychological process of integrating the conscious with the unconscious while still maintaining conscious autonomy. Individuation was the central concept of analytical psychology.\n\nJungian ideas are not typically included in curriculum of most major universities' psychology departments, but are occasionally explored in humanities departments. Many pioneering psychological concepts were originally proposed by Jung, including the Archetype, the Collective Unconscious, the Complex, and synchronicity. A popular psychometric instrument, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), has been principally developed from Jung's theories.\n\n\n&quot;Study wisely, study diligently.&quot;\n\n\nFiles: \n\nSee file list.\n\n&quot;The Red Book&quot;, the &quot;Liber Novus&quot; is included both in the original German edition and in an English translation.\n\nJung's important &quot;Septem Sermones ad Mortuos&quot; can be found at the end of &quot;Carl Gustav Jung - Memories, Dreams, Reflections.pdf&quot; on p.378.\n\nThere are txt-file copies of several PDF-books for your e-book reader contained in this torrent. Some of these PDF-files will put a heavy load on your CPU. That's because many of them aren't OCR-files but image-files. This looks very nice, but it's rather large. TXT-files are searchable, image files are not. That's why you need both of them. On the other hand, TXT-files are missing pictures and graphics, and are also lacking the antiquarian atmosphere.\n\nThis will likely be the last torrent in the current &quot;Carl Gustav Jung series&quot;. This collection of books from the master is rather unique, and you will have a hard time finding a better collection of Jung's books on the net. Enjoy!\n\n\n&quot;Many caves are located only after a diligent search.&quot;\n",
