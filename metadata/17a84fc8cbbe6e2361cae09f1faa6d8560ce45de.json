These are not my rips, nor my subs. I put them together. You can download this torrent if you cannot wait for better subs. I synced them to the video track, which is ok. The subs are not that good, but good enough to follow what's going on. Soft-subs, by the way.\n\n\nGOMORRA (2014)\n\nThe series is based on the book Gomorrah by Roberto Saviano, and on the film Gomorrah directed by Matteo Garrone, which won the 2008 Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\nIMDB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2049116/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2049116/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a84fc8cbbe6e2361cae09f1faa6d8560ce45de","amp;dn":"Gomorra+-+The+Series+-+Season+1+%282014%29+%28English+subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a84fc8cbbe6e2361cae09f1faa6d8560ce45de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,168,79,200,203,190,110,35,97,202,224,159,31,170,109,133,96,206,69,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
