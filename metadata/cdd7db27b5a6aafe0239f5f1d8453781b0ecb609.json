Obsessed with finding the link between hundreds of unsolved cases, Emmy has taken leave from her job as an FBI researcher. Now all she has are the newspaper clippings that wallpaper her bedroom, and her recurring nightmares of an all-consuming fire.\n\nNot even Emmy's ex-boyfriend, field agent Harrison &quot;Books&quot; Bookman, will believe her that hundreds of kidnappings, rapes, and murders are all connected. That is, until Emmy finds a piece of evidence he can't afford to ignore. More murders are reported by the day--and they're all inexplicable. No motives, no murder weapons, no suspects. Could one person really be responsible for these unthinkable crimes?\n\nINVISIBLE is James Patterson's scariest, most chilling stand-alone thriller yet.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd7db27b5a6aafe0239f5f1d8453781b0ecb609","amp;dn":"Invisible+by+James+Patterson%2C+David+Ellis+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd7db27b5a6aafe0239f5f1d8453781b0ecb609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,215,219,39,181,166,170,254,2,57,245,241,216,69,55,129,176,236,182,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
