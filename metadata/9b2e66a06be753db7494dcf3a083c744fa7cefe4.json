  "description": "Opeth - The Sorceress Principle (EP) 2016 320ak\r\n\r\nOpeth is a Swedish heavy metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. The group has been through several personnel changes, but singer, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Ã…kerfeldt has remained Opeth's only founding member and primary driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth is also well-known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 2016, Nuclear Blast Entertainment announced the signing of Opeth.Three days later, on June 18th, Opeth released a 30-second teaser for their new album, Sorceress. A month later, on July 18th, the band confirmed the album would be released on September 30th, in addition to revealing the artwork and track list. Mikael Ã…kerfeldt described it as &quot;a fine little record. My favorite in our discography right now. Of course. That's how it should be, right? It's both fresh and old, both progressive and rehashed. Heavy and calm. Just the way we like it.&quot; The album will be the first project under Moderbolaget Records, a joint venture between Opeth and Nuclear Blast. Moderbolaget means &quot;parent&quot; in Swedish.\r\n\r\nOn July 25, 2016, in the build up towards the album release, the band posted the first 'Sorceress' Making Of Webisode on their YouTube channel.\r\nAnd the EP &quot;The Sorceress Principal&quot; appeared on torrent sites. Excluding the now defunct KAT which was taken down due to problems with deletion of material(they were deleting far to much ) They hope to make a comeback but they are not The Pirate Bay so a proper return from it is doubtful. \r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01  Sorceress.mp3\r\n02  Serenity Painted Death.mp3\r\n03  Into The Frost Of Winter.mp3\r\n04  Bridge of Sighs.mp3\r\n05  Demon Of The Fall.mp3\r\n\r\n1Opsoc..1.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nBand members\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mikael Ã…kerfeldt â€“ guitars, vocals (1990â€“present), lead vocals (1992â€“present), acoustic guitar, sound effects, mixing, engineering, production, bass guitar, grand piano\r\n    MartÃ­n MÃ©ndez â€“ bass guitar, upright bass (1997â€“present)\r\n    Martin &quot;Axe&quot; Axenrot â€“ drums, percussion (2005â€“present)[95]\r\n    Fredrik Ã…kesson â€“ guitars, backing vocals (2007â€“present)\r\n    Joakim Svalberg â€“ keyboards, synthesizer, piano, mellotron, backing vocals, percussion (2011â€“present",
