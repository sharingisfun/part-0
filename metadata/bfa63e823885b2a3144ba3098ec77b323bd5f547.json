  "description": "\nThis torrent contains all issues of the main Fables series up to date.  Also included are the two Cinderella mini-series, written by Chris Roberson, as well as the 2 original graphic novels.  In addition to ALL that, I've included the 3 issues of The Literals, and 3 issues of Jack of Fables, which are the remaining issues of the &quot;Great Fables Crossover&quot;.  I've put the entire crossover event in reading order, in a separate folder for reading convenience.\n*Note: I plan to release update torrents after the conclusion of each Fables story arc in the future.\n========================================================\n\n\nWhen the Adversary conquered the lands of legends, the inhabitants were forced into exile. They form a secret society, a hidden enclave in modern-day New York. Bill Willingham's award-winning &quot;fractured-fairy-tale&quot; series explores the world of these beloved fables...one that exists within our own.\n\n\nThanks goes to GrumpyBear, Madvillain, RacerX, Steam, Hatful of Hollow, theProletariat, and all the other wonderful scanners who brought these fine books to our community.\n\n",
