GAME.TYPE ........: Simulation, Sports\n\nFM 2014 features a rehauled transfer module in which opposing clubs and\nmanagers adopt a more realistic approach when making or responding to\ntransfer offers. Additional, a host of new real world' transfer clauses\nhave been added, such as the facility to loan a player back to the club he\nhas just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of money and\nloan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance\nfee. Beyond this, the old turn-based' system of transfer negotiations can\nnow be accomplished two ways, the tried and tested system and a new live\nsystem, similar to that used in Football Manager's contract negotiations\n\n1.
