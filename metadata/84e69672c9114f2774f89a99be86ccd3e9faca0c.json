  "description": "The Ramones - Discography 1976-1997 [Mp3 256 kbps] TNT Village\n\n.: Release Originale :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=71006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=71006&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Ramones were an American rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens, in 1974. They are often cited as the first punk rock group. Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the punk rock movement both in the United States and the United Kingdom. All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname &quot;Ramone&quot;, though none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded.[3] By a little more than eight years after the breakup, the band's three founding membersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½lead singer Joey Ramone, guitarist Johnny Ramone, and bassist Dee Dee RamoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½had died.\n\nTheir only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold was the compilation album Ramones Mania. However, recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now cited in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the Rolling Stone list of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only The Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the RamonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including the three founders and drummers Marky and Tommy RamoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n.: The Ramones Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img810.imageshack.us/img810/8674/ramones1l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img810.imageshack.us/img810/8674/ramones1l.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n01 Ramones - 1976\n02 Leave Home - 1977\n03 RocketTo Russia - 1977\n04 Road to Ruin - 1978\n05 Its Alive - 1979\n06 End Of The Century - 1980\n07 Pleasant Dreams - 1981\n08 Subterrean Jungle - 1983\n09 Too Tough To_Die - 1985\n10 Animal Boy - 1986\n11 Halfway To Sanity - 1987\n12 Brain drain - 1989\n13 Loco Live - 1991\n14 Mondo Bizzaro - 1992\n15 Acid Eaters - 1993\n16 Adios Amigos - 1995\n17 Greatest Hits Live - 1996\n18 Were Outta Here - 1997",
