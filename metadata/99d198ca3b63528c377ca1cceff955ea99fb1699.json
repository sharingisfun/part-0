In June 2015, teams at CERN started running the large hadron collider at the highest energy ever. Rumours quickly emerged that they were on the brink of a huge discovery. A mysterious bump in some data suggested a first glimpse of a brand new particle that could change our understanding of how the universe works.\r\nA new particle could hint at extra dimensions and help us understand the very beginning of the universe - but first the team has to find it. Horizon follows the scientists as they hunt for the elusive signals that would prove if there is a new particle or if it is just noise from their machine.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/Inside-Cern-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Inside-Cern-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5c/Inside-Cern-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Inside-Cern-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Inside-Cern-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Inside-Cern-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/Inside-Cern-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Inside-Cern-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/Inside-Cern-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~3655Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.56 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07nsxkk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99d198ca3b63528c377ca1cceff955ea99fb1699","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2016+Inside+Cern+1080p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99d198ca3b63528c377ca1cceff955ea99fb1699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,209,152,202,59,99,82,140,55,124,161,204,239,249,85,234,153,251,22,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
