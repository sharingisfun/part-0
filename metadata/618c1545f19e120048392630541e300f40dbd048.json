  "description": "Take Care is the upcoming second studio album by Canadian recording artist Drake, scheduled for release through Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Universal Republic Records on November 15, 2011.[1] The album will be released in three versions: the Standard edition, the Birthday edition and the OG Ron C edition.[2] Singles &quot;Headlines&quot; and &quot;Make Me Proud&quot; preceded the album's release, each attaining chart success on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOn November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album would be Take Care.[3] In comparison to his debut album Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, &quot;I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed a lot of the songs and sonically I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' &quot;Once it was done, it was done. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why my new album is called Take Care because I get to take my time this go-round.&quot; [4] Drake mentioned after OVO Fest 2011 that Take Care could have up to 18 songs on it, and added that Stevie Wonder contributed to the creative direction of the album and will be featured on the album as well. Drake also revealed that the album was recorded mainly in Toronto.[5] Debating whether to submit his final cut or not, Drake's preferred release date motivated him to create a Birthday Edition, much like a deluxe edition to be released on the iTunes Store.[2]\n\nSome producers that were revealed to be working with Drake on Take Care other than Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib (who is the main producer of the album) include T-Minus,[6] Jamie Smith from The xx,[7] The Neptunes,[8] Q-Tip (It is unclear whether the tracks Q-Tip has produced will be on Take Care),[9] and Boi-1da (who is a long-time Drake collaborator).[10] He had initially recruited 9th Wonder for the album.[11] He even appeared on 9th's documentary The Wonder Year and expressed his desire to make a number one hit with him.[12] However, in an interview about a month prior to the slated release date, 9th said that he didn't think he would appear on the album.[13] 9th states that part of the reason he thought he didn't make the cut is because he was going through an A&amp;R and playing beats for them as opposed to the artist himself, which he is opposed to.[14] Some artists that are confirmed to be collaborators with Drake on Take Care consist of Stevie Wonder, Kendrick Lamar, Chantal Kreviazuk,[15], AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© 3000, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna.[16]\n\nThe first track Drake released was &quot;Dreams Money Can Buy&quot; on May 20, 2011 through his October's Very Own blog. Drake mentioned this song was &quot;A Story of Dreams, mixed with reality,&quot; and that this was not his first single off the album but that it would be included on Take Care.[17] On June 9, 2011, a second track titled &quot;Marvins Room&quot; was released via his blog. Drake initially stated that the song would not be featured on Take Care, but because of the song's unexpected success, prompting it was released as a digital and radio single on July 22, 2011 and will be on Take Care. &quot;Trust Issues&quot; was then released shortly after on his blog, but is confirmed not to be on the album via Drake's Twitter. He explained that the song was an idea he had from I'm On One and made it &quot;just for fun.&quot;[18][19] However, in an interview, Drake stated that Trust Issues, along with Dreams Money Can Buy, will be included in the Birthday Edition of the album.[20] On September 10, 2011, Drake released a new song titled &quot;Club Paradise&quot; on his October's Very Own blog.[21] &quot;Dropping this for our boy Avery...this was his favorite sh*t during the recording process. 2 more songs coming tonight as well. ovoxo,&quot; he wrote on his blog. On September 11, 2011, Drake released another track entitled &quot;Free Spirit&quot; featuring Rick Ross and blogged that another was to be released that night, as well. [22] Later that night he released a remix of Waka Flocka Flame's &quot;Round of Applause&quot;. On September 23, 2011, Drake released the official album cover to Take Care.[23] On October 20, 2011, an unfinished version of &quot;The Real Her&quot; featuring only Lil Wayne was leaked online.[24] The Club Paradise Tour was revealed to start in November on Twitter. However, It was revealed that the tour is delayed until after Christmas/New Year break so Drake could perform at more schools.[25][1]\n\nOn October 8, 2011, Drake announced on his OVO blog that Take Care will be pushed back until November 15th because of three sample clearances. It was originally to be released on his 25th birthday, October 24, 2011.[25][1]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[16]\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tProducer(s) \tLength\n1. \t&quot;Over My Dead Body&quot;   \t  \t  \t4:33\n2. \t&quot;Shot For Me&quot;   \t  \t  \t3:45\n3. \t&quot;Headlines&quot;   \tAubrey Graham, Matthew Samuels, Noah Shebib, Adrian Eccleston \tBoi-1da, Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib (co.) \t3:56\n4. \t&quot;Crew Love&quot; (featuring The Weeknd) \tGraham, Abel Tesfaye, Daniel McKinney \tDoc McKinney, Illangelo \t3:29\n5. \t&quot;Take Care&quot; (featuring Rihanna) \t  \t  \t4:38\n6. \t&quot;Marvins Room / Buried Alive (Interlude) (featuring Kendrick Lamar)&quot;   \tGraham, Shebib, Eccleston, Jason Beck \t'Marvins Room' produced by Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib\n'Buried Alive Interlude' produced by TBA \t8:16\n7. \t&quot;Under Ground Kings&quot;   \t  \t9th Wonder \t3:33\n8. \t&quot;WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Be Fine&quot;   \t  \t  \t4:09\n9. \t&quot;Make Me Proud&quot; (featuring Nicki Minaj) \tGraham, Onika Maraj, Tyler Williams, Nikhil Seetharam, Shebib \tT-Minus, Kromatik (co.) \t3:40\n10. \t&quot;Lord Knows&quot; (featuring Rick Ross) \t  \tJust Blaze \t5:08\n11. \t&quot;Cameras / Good Ones Go (Interlude)&quot;   \t  \tLex Luger \t7:14\n12. \t&quot;Doing It Wrong&quot; (featuring Stevie Wonder) \t  \tNoah &quot;40&quot; Shebib \t4:26\n13. \t&quot;The Real Her&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne and AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© 3000) \t  \tNoah &quot;40&quot; Shebib \t5:22\n14. \t&quot;HYFR (Hell Ya Fuckin' Right)&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne) \t  \t  \t3:27\n15. \t&quot;Look What YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Done&quot;   \t  \t  \t5:03\n16. \t&quot;Practice&quot;   \t  \t  \t3:57\n17. \t&quot;The Ride&quot;   \t  \t  \t \n[hide]iTunes Store and deluxe edition bonus tracks\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tProducer(s) \tLength\n18. \t&quot;Hate Sleeping Alone&quot;   \t  \t  \t \n19. \t&quot;The Motto&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne) \tGraham, Dwayne Carter, Jr., Williams \tT-Minus \t3:01",
