Their debut album, Under The Pipal Tree, outlined that mission in twisted, psychedelic fury. Subsequent albums would see the band honing their craft, mastering their mission, and ultimately abandoning that path in favor of more grandiose pursuits.\n\nFlanked by increasingly larger orchestras, MONO performed live at some of the most prestigious venues in New York City, London, Tokyo, and Australia. MONO had become an orchestral rock band, a spectacle of extreme melancholy and melodrama. On 2012's For My Parents, the band had finally reached the logical conclusion of that era; it was time to remember where they started, and to rethink where they were heading. Less strings? No strings? Louder? Quieter? Lighter? Darker? Yes.\n\nThe Last Dawn and Rays of Darkness are a pair of new albums by MONO. Recorded simultaneously yet conceptually and creatively disparate, the two act as both opposing and complementary sides to a story.\n\nNo strangers to narratives, the two albums explore familiar themes for the band: Hope and hopelessness, love and loss, immense joy and unspeakable pain. Those elemental parts of life and the complicated relationships they create have never been more resonant through MONO's music than they are here.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nTakaakira &quot;Taka&quot; Goto - Guitar\nTamaki - Bass, Piano, Glockenspiel\nYoda - Guitar\nYasunori Takada - Drums, Glockenspiel, Timpani\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nUnder The Pipal Tree (2001)\nOne Step More And You Die (2003)\nWalking Cloud And Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered And The Sun Shined (2004)\nYou Are There (2006)\nHymn To The Immortal Wind (2009)\nThe Last Dawn / Rays Of Darkness (2014)\n\n\n\nThe Last Dawn (2014)\n\n\n\n01.
