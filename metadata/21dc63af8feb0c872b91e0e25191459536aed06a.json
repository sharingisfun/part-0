  "description": "Customize your security for your needs\navast! Pro Antivirus offers simple controls for keeping yourself virus-free in 2013 and allows you to customize it the way that best fits your personal computing habits.\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lose your game\nSilent gaming mode means you can play (or surf) without interruption. Pro Antivirus works silently in the background when you want it to, without notifications or changes to system performance.\nShop and bank online without worry\nSafeZoneÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is a private and isolated virtual window on your desktop, for securing your sensitive financial transactions online. Perfect for auction sites, buying tickets, booking hotels or airlines, online gaming, or any sort of monetary transfer.\nSurf and socialize without worry\nSandbox lets you surf the web and run even risky programs virtually, outside your PC. And our Web, IM, and P2P shields ensure your safety on social networks (e.g.or Twitter) and online dating sites, IM chats (e.g. Skype or ICQ), or peer-to-peer file-sharing sites.\nBenefit from real-time protection\nHybrid cloud technology streams your virus database updates to your PC in real-time, so your avast! software has all virus definitions as soon as they are known to our Virus Lab.\nKnow whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming before you click\nOur cloud-based FileRep feature keeps reputation data on millions of files, so we can warn you of a fileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation before you open it.\nManage avast! on all your devices\nYour AVAST Account portal is your personal directory for all your avast! related data, for all your desktop and mobile devices. Each month, we also prepare for you a Security Report that shows an overview of the most significant details (e.g. number of infected sites blocked).\nGet help from a Ã¢â‚¬ËœGeekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in your network\nOur new Remote Assistance lets you initiate remote support from a family member or friend who agrees to help. Initiated by you, it routes through AVASTÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s servers, bypasses firewalls, and can be terminated by you at any time.",
