With the vast collection of ready-made presets, mixing music is not only easy and incredibly fast Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you end up with results second to none.\n\nAll the previous functionality and content from EZmix is still intact and working in EZmix 2. The major difference however, is that the new and revamped version comes with settings based on high-tech mastering effects, new reverb algorithms, guitar/bass amp and cab simulation, a completely revised interface and a large core content boost. Essentially, EZmix 2 is a mixing engineer, mastering suite and guitar/bass amp all rolled up into one package.\nStart mixing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s EZ!\nEffects\nEZmix 2 is a powerful package that combines a multitude of quality studio effects with the know-how of professional engineers. As soon as you select one of EZmixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pre-designed settings, a complex chain of effect units instantly loads seamlessly in the background. See Details for in-depth information.\nThe professional touch\nMaking professional mixes has never been easier! Having a vast array of available effects to choose from, the signal-chain settings in EZmix 2 and all EZmix Packs were carefully crafted by seasoned mixing engineers. Lend some pro secrets and platinum record magic to your music by letting seasoned veterans do the tweaking for you!\nGuitar/bass amp and speaker simulation\nEZmix 2 has a large amount of ready-made settings based on some of the most classic vintage and contemporary guitar and bass amps, speakers and stomp boxes. Whether you are working stand-alone or in a host; plug your instrument straight into your sound card and select a preset!\nLow CPU usage\nCombing several plugins on multiple channels can slow down even the fastest computer. With EZmix 2 you only use ONE instance on each channel instead of MANY and end up reducing your CPU usage to a minimum. With EZmix 2 you can make flawless mixes on low resource systems or in mobile situations!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack EZMix All Expansions Pack v1.0.0 11.1.2014 WiN and OSX\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Core.Expansion.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Metal.Amps.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Metal.Essentials.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Neil.Dorfsman.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Andy.Sneap.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Mastering.II.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Mastering.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Randy.Staub.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Songwriters.Tools.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Rock.v1.0.0.R2.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n[img][/img]\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Modern.Pop.Rock.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Peter.Henderson.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Vocal.Toolbox.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Mark.Needham.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Lead.Vocals.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.The.Mix.Toolbox.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Metal.v1.0.0.R2.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Drums.Toolbox.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Dirt.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Metal.Guitar.Gods.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Chuch.Ainlay.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Electronic.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Amps.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Bass.Toolbox.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\nToontrack.EMX.Alternative.Rock.v1.0.0.WIN.OSX-R2R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\n\nWindows\n\nWindows XP SP3 or newer, Pentium 4 or Athlon processor with 512 MB RAM\n\nMac\n\nMac OS X 10.5 or higher, G5 with 512 MB RAM (Intel-based Mac recommended)\n\n40 MB of free hard disc space.
