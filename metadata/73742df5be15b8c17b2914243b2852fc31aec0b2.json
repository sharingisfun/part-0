Gaps that stop you short of being able to claim status as a TRUE man. \n\nThe good news is that-in Convict Conditioning-Paul Wade has laid out a brilliant 6-set system of 10 progressions which allows you to master these elite levels. And you could be starting at almost any age and in almost in any condition! \n\nPaul Wade has given you the keys-ALL the keys you'll ever need- that will open door after door after door for you in quest for REAL physical accomplishment. Yes, it will be the hardest work you'll ever have to do. And yes, 97% of those who pick up Convict Conditioning, frankly, won't have the guts and the fortitude to make it. But if you make it even half-way through Paul's Progressions, you'll be stronger than almost anyone you encounter. \n\nIf you're a 3-percenter, in particular, then this book is for you. Have at it!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
