  "description": "The Complete Ocean Skipper: Deep-water Voyaging, Navigation and Yacht Management\r\nby Tom Cunliffe\r\nAdlard Coles | April 2016 | ISBN-10: 1472918134 | ePUB | 17.6 mb\r\n\r\nBuilding off of his bestselling Complete Day Skipper and Complete Yachtmaster, yachting legend Tom Cunliffe turns his attention to the third strand of the RYA syllabus. With the same hugely popular, highly practical approach, Complete Ocean Skipper covers everything a yachtsman needs to know when planning an offshore cruise or ocean passage.\r\nAll aspects of planning and preparing for--as well as setting out on--a long-distance cruise are covered.\r\nA unique and definitive handbook, Complete Ocean Skipper goes beyond the theory of the RYA syllabus to ensure that readers are equipped with the knowledge of both what to do and how to do it. A veteran offshore yachtsman as well as an RYA examiner, Tom Cunliffe brings his experience to bear and packs this must-have guide with invaluable hands-on advice for offshore and coastal sailors alike.\r\nWith clear, helpful color photographs and diagrams throughout, this is the essential book for anyone planning for or dreaming about sailing farther afield.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nTom Cunliffe has been sailing for most of his life. He has sailed his own yachts from the Caribbean to Russia and from Brazil to the Arctic. He has worked in all branches of the sailing profession, is a regular columnist for leading sailing magazines in the UK &amp; USA, and is the author of the bestselling Compete Day Skipper and Complete Yachmaster in this series.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nINTRODUCTION: THE OCEAN SKIPPER\r\nPART 1 â€¢ THE OFFSHORE YACHT\r\n1 HULLS FOR OCEAN SAILING\r\n2 SAILING RIGS FOR DEEP WATER\r\n3 ENGINES\r\n4 STEERING\r\n5 SYSTEMS\r\n6 ACCOMMODATION\r\nPART 2 â€¢ OCEAN NAVIGATION AND DEEP-SEA SEAMANSHIP\r\n7 WEATHER\r\n8 HOT AND COLD\r\n9 THE TOOLS OF OCEAN NAVIGATION\r\n10 ESSENTIAL CELESTIAL NAVIGATION\r\n11 PASSAGE PLANNING\r\n12 GREAT CIRCLE SAILING AND PASSAGE EXECUTION\r\n13 DAY-TO-DAY SEAMANSHIP\r\n14 SYSTEM MANAGEMENT\r\n15 DEALING WITH HEAVY WEATHER\r\n16 IN HARBOUR\r\n17 EXTREME EMERGENCIES\r\nPART 3 â€¢ LIFE ON BOARD\r\n18 CREW\r\n19 HEALTH AT SEA\r\n20 BUREAUCRACY\r\n21 FOOD AND WATER\r\n22 COMPUTERS, THE INTERNET AND RADIO COMMUNICATION\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\nFURTHER READING\r\n \nhttp://s9.postimg.org/j9g38qz8v/The_Complete_Ocean_Skipper.jpg",
