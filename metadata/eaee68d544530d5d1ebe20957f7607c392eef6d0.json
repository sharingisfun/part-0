  "description": "The Paper Kites are an indie folk band from Melbourne, Australia. The band was formed in 2009 by Sam Bentley and Christina Lacy and consists of Bentley, Lacy, Dave Powys, Josh Bentley and Sam Rasmussen. With their debut EP Woodland and follow-up EP Young North, Australian indie-folk outfit The Paper Kites melds earthy instrumentals to create a perfect backdrop for the band's harmonies. The standout tracks from Woodland - &quot;Bloom&quot; and &quot;Featherstone&quot; (as prominently featured in the season 8 finale of Grey's Anatomy) - have generated over 5 million combined YouTube views. Following the success of Woodland, The Paper Kites released indie-tinged folk-rock with Young North. Sam Bentley's vocals steer single &quot;A Maker of My Time,&quot; like a ship through choppy waves.\n\n\nmp3 @ 320CBR",
