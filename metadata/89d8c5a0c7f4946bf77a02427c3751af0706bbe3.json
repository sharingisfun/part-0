  "description": "iZotope Ozone 7 Advanced v7.00 OS X [dada]\r\n342 MB\r\n\r\nAU/AAX7RTAS/VST/VST3/APP format.\r\n\r\nOpen with Keka (.7z)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nhttps://www.izotope.com/en/products/mixing-mastering/ozone/\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhat's new in Ozone 7 and Ozone 7 Advanced?\r\n\r\nVintage Tape [Advanced only]\r\n\r\nThe Vintage Tape module brings the distinctive richness and warmth of tape saturation to your modern digital recordings with all the frequency coloration, distortion, and phase effects of tape. Take advantage of analog tone for masters that sound more musical with added dimension, fatness, and depth.\r\n\r\nVintage EQ [Advanced only]\r\n\r\nWith the richness, warmth, and color of Pultec equalizers, Vintage EQ lets you brighten your master, smooth out heavy lows, and add body to your digital recordings. Discrete frequency value selections let you boost and cut separately â€” but at the same time! â€” without ending up with a â€œboomyâ€ master.\r\n\r\nVintage Compressor [Advanced only]\r\n\r\nVintage Compressor is a single-band compression module for subtle warming and sweetening effects. The program-dependent release tailors release shapes depending on your material to adapt naturally to your music. Thicken the midrange, tighten and round out the lows, let the top sparkle, and get authentic vintage character.\r\n\r\nCodec Preview [Advanced only]\r\n\r\nGet a real-time listen to how your master will sound in various industry-standard codecs with Codec Preview. Preview the sound of a compressed master within your DAW or the Ozone standalone application. Instantly make adjustments to perfect the audio for streaming or online music stores with this easy-to-use tool that improves your workflow. \r\n\r\nVintage Limiter\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Tube&quot; mode that was part of the Maximizer in Ozone 6.1 has been broken out to its own module, the new Vintage Limiter, and got an upgrade with faster and slower settings. Glue a mix together and add character with the Vintage Limiterâ€™s warmer, analog-sounding final-stage limiting while retaining the ease and precision of digital maximizing. Bring a natural feel to harsh and digital-sounding masters. Get a silky warmth and body and the nostalgic vibe of the classic records you grew up with.\r\n\r\nExport Formats\r\n\r\nSpecify the file format for export from a variety of compressed or uncompressed popular choices like MP3, WAV, and AAC. You no longer need to output to .wav and then use a separate MP3 converter. Now you can export your digital formats directly from your source files and add metadata before export, including track name, band name, album name, and more.\r\n\r\nUpgraded Maximizer with IRC IV\r\n\r\nOzoneâ€™s legendary mastering limiter features a new algorithm (IRC IV) with multiband and frequency-specific operation, so that the limiter doesn't have to work as hard. Get even more transparent mixes with less pumping at higher volumes â€” ideal for when you need to tame the kick drum peaks without causing vocals to pump. The former &quot;Tube&quot; mode of the Maximizer has been expanded to its own new Vintage Limiter module and is backwards compatible with Ozone 6.1 presets.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfuture-dada\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndemonoid.pw\r\n1337x.to\r\nthepiratebay.se\r\nflashtorrents.org\r\nbtscene.cc\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMMXV (11)",
