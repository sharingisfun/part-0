His experiences, after the secret radio he built to bring news and hope to his colleagues was discovered, left him traumatised and shut off from the world. Years later, he met Patti, a beautiful woman, on a train and fell in love. Patti was determined to rid Eric of his demons. Discovering that the young Japanese officer who haunted her husband was still alive, she faced a terrible decision. Should Eric be given a chance to confront his tormentor? Would she stand by him, whatever he did?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53529a3eae329.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53529a3eae329.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53529a3eca154.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53529a3eca154.html&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53529a3ef0b47.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://istoreimg.com/i/53529a3ef0b47.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f8a8443977d0d9e1287ba6730ddda48b5270910","amp;dn":"The+Railway+Man+%282013%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f8a8443977d0d9e1287ba6730ddda48b5270910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,138,132,67,151,125,13,158,18,135,186,103,48,221,218,72,181,39,9,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
