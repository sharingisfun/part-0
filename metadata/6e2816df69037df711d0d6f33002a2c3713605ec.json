They treat it as a craft. They are professionals.\r\n \r\nIn The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical adviceâ€“about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.\r\n \r\nReaders will learn:\r\n\r\n* What it means to behave as a true software craftsman\r\n* How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers\r\n* How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writerâ€™s block\r\n* How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout\r\n* How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms\r\n* How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps\r\n* How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive\r\n* When to say â€œNoâ€â€“and how to say it\r\n* When to say â€œYesâ€â€“and what yes really means\r\n \r\nGreat software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isnâ€™t written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. The Clean Coder will help you become one of themâ€“and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e2816df69037df711d0d6f33002a2c3713605ec","amp;dn":"The+Clean+Coder+-+1st+Edition+%282011%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e2816df69037df711d0d6f33002a2c3713605ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,40,22,223,105,3,125,247,17,208,214,243,48,2,162,195,113,54,5,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
