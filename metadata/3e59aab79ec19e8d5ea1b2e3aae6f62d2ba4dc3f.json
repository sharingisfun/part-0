The images are of stunning bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms; and insightful text complements them to reveal why the minimalist rooms are so eye-catching, cathartic, and desirable. The text includes a wealth of both big picture and more focused ideas. It covers subjects such as walls (if and when to use them), doors, and partitions, flooring, lighting, furniture, and staircases, and explores color, patterns, materials, and texture.\n\nThe homes featured in this extraordinary volume were developed by distinguished international designers at the forefront of the minimalist movement. The result is a guide that offers both inspiration and how-to advice for creating maximum beauty using minimal elements.\n\n150 Best Minimalist House Ideas\nBook Language: English\nPages: 504\nFile Type: epub\nFile Size: 68 MB\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yyljlHQ.jpg[/IMG]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yyljlHQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yyljlHQ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
