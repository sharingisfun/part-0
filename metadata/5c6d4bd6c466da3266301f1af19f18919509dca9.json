While in DC, why not participate in the local\ncommunity, and run a few political errands?\n\nUp to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the\njobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more\nmoney and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character\ncustomization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize\ntheir own guns and gear.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Rob Banks with Friends - Players must choose their crew\ncarefully, because when the job goes down they will\nneed the right mix of skills on their side.\n- CRIMENET - The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and\nchoose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts\nsuch as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician &quot;The Elephant&quot;,\nand South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their\nown agenda and best interests in mind.\n- PAYDAY gun play and mechanics on a new level - firing\nweapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.\n- Dynamic Scenarios - No heist ever plays out the same way twice.\nEvery single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.\n- Choose Your Skills - As players progress they can invest in any\nof four special Skill Trees: the Mastermind, the Enforcer, the\nGhost and the Technician. Each features a deep customization\ntree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they\ncan be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.\n- More Masks than Ever - PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask\nsystem, giving players the ability to craft their own unique\nmask together with a pattern and a color combination.\n- Weapons and Modifications - A brand new arsenal for the serious\nheister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to\ncompact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you\ncan modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles,\nbarrels, frames, stocks, all of which will affect the\nperformance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic\nenhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with\npolished walnut grips for your nine?\n- Play It Your Way - Each job allows for multiple approaches,\nsuch as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns\nblazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch\nas the heist unfolds accordingly.\n\nInstallation Information:\n\n- Burn or mount\n- Install\n- Play the game\n\nNOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\nNote: We need anything you can offer as early releases,seedboxes,links,accounts,etc\nplease contact us on piratepedia[@]gmail.com or our website torentz 3xforum ro\nSeed Stats: 20-400 GiB at aprox 10 MiB/sec/20 slots per torrent\n\nPAYDAY 2-FLT Torrent Free Download\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/extremezone/0/7/0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHow To Get Your MAXSPEED (uTorrent)\n\nTorrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each \nTorrent Client - Preferences - BiTorrent - Protocol Encryption - Forced\nBandwidth Allocation - High (Set download/upload limit - Unlimited)\nStop Other Active Torrents - Start downloading and wait for connections.\nEnjoy and Seed for at least 1:1 ratio.
