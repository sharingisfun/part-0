Unlike competing products, backups automatically skip unused data blocks to provide faster results with less storage requirements.\r\n\r\nIncremental Backups\r\nIncremental backups identify only the changes made since the last backup, significantly reducing backup time, network consumption, and storage requirements.\r\n\r\nMultiple Backup Targets\r\nStore backup copies in up to 5 different locations for flexible, reliable recovery options. Includes support for local disks, networked storage, and offsite cloud storage.\r\n\r\nGranular Recovery\r\n\r\n\r\nAcronis Backup to Cloud\r\nAll Acronis Backup products have direct access to secure, offsite storage in the Acronis cloud. Simply add a subscription to your purchase to fortify your backup storage plan and double your data protection.\r\n\r\nSystem Performance\r\nNetwork bandwidth and disk-write speed throttling allows you to control the impact of running backups during production hours.\r\n\r\nActive Restore\r\nIntelligent restore feature immediately identifies and recovers core system functions, allowing you to return to regular operations while system recovery proceeds.\r\n\r\nAcronis Startup Recovery Manager\r\nBootable rescue utility that you can launch by pressing F11 during system startup.\r\n\r\nExclude Files\r\nManually exclude non-essential files and folders from your backups to save time and storage.\r\n\r\nGranular Backups\r\nGranular backup option allows you to selectively back up specific files and folders (including files from network shares).\r\n\r\nDisaster Recovery Plans\r\nAfter each backup, Acronis can automatically generate a Disaster Recovery Plan document that provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for easy recovery.\r\n\r\nServer Migration\r\n\r\n\r\nBrowsing and Mounting Backups\r\nBrowse backups in Windows Explorer as if they were ordinary folders, and simply drag-and-drop or copy-paste files/folders from them. You can even mount disk images as a drive letter in either read-only or read/write mode.\r\n\r\nSector-By-Sector Backups\r\nStore an exact copy of your disk or volume, sector by sector (including unused space).\r\n\r\nNo Reboot Required\r\nNo need to schedule downtime and reboot to complete an Acronis Backup installation.\r\n\r\nPre/Post Commands\r\nDefine pre or post backup and data-capture commands to integrate Acronis Backup with other applications (or to temporarily stop some services).\r\n\r\nReplication\r\nTo satisfy your recovery time objectives (RTO), Acronis simplifies DR with a one-click option to automatically replicate backups to multiple media and locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------+\r\n| How to use |\r\n+----------------+\r\n1) Open _ReadMe.txt and read Instructions \r\n\r\n\r\nSupport topic:  http://techtools.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=12\r\n\r\n   \r\nAny comments on quality appreciated\r\n\r\nThumperDC / TechTools\r\n\r\n\r\n====================================================================================\r\nIf you need help please post in our forum, Thanks  http://techtools.net/\r\n====================================================================================",
