It captures the beauty and awe of the heavens through images from antiquarian celestial prints and star atlases. This book uniquely combines a number of features: 1) the history of celestial cartography is traced from ancient to modern times; 2) this development is integrated with contemporary cosmological systems; 3) the artistry of sky maps is shown using beautiful color images from actual celestial atlases and prints; 4) each illustration is accompanied by a legend explaining what is being shown; and 5) the text is written for the lay reader based on the author's experience with writing articles for amateur astronomy and map collector magazines.\nThis updated second edition of 'Star Maps' contains over 50 new pages of text and 44 new images (16 in color), including completely new sections on celestial frontispieces, deep-sky objects, playing card maps, additional cartographers, and modern computerized star maps. There is also expanded material about celestial globes, volvelles, telescopes, and planets and asteroids.\n\nAbout the Author\nNick Kanas, M. D, is Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He has been a member of the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers since 1978 and has collected and researched antiquarian celestial books, atlases, and prints for nearly 25 years. He is a member of several map collector societies and has lectured on the history of celestial cartography at scientific and non-scientific meetings of organizations such as the Sydney (Australia) Observatory, the 20th International Conference on the History of Cartography, and the California Map Society. He also has written articles on this subject for a number of journals and magazines, including Sky &amp; Telescope, Mercury, Imago Mundi, Mercator's World, and the Journal of the International Map Collectors' Society. Professor Kanas has written over 160 professional articles and 3 books, including, with D. Manzey, Space Psychology and Psychiatry (Kluwer/Springer, 2003), which won the 2004 International Academy of Astronautics Life Science Book Award.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface to Second Edition . . . xv\nForeword to First Edition . . . xvii\nPreface to First Edition . . . xix\nAcknowledgments . . . xxv\nList of figures . . . xxvii\nList of tables . . . xxxiii\nList of abbreviations and acronyms . . . xxxv\n1 What is a star map?. . . 1\n2 Non-European cosmology and constellation development . . . 17\n3 European cosmology. . . 49\n4 European constellation development . . . 107\n5 Early European star maps . . . 133\n6 The Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬ËœBig FourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ of the Golden Age of pictorial star maps . . . 151\n7 Other important star maps of the Golden Age . . . 191\n8 Special topics . . . 225\n9 Mapping the stars in early America  . . . 315\n10 The transition to non-pictorial star maps . . . 337\nAPPENDICES\nA Collecting celestial maps and prints . . . 465\nB Supplementary reference catalog . . . 473\nC Indices of major constellation atlases . . . 499\nD The British Library Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬ËœKingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ edition . . . 509\nE Glossary . . . 511\nIndex . . . 519\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LnI8vnX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LnI8vnX.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2134d712759e84d0ccdab78dc60cf4718288b418","amp;dn":"Star+Maps+-+History%2C+Artistry%2C+and+Cartography+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2134d712759e84d0ccdab78dc60cf4718288b418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,52,215,18,117,158,132,208,204,218,183,141,198,12,244,113,130,136,180,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
