This is all Daeron's work on riping DVD and subs.\nI'm only bringing this masterpiece to public tracker. Certainly, there're a lot of Stalker's rips on net, but this one is the best I've seen. And - again thanks to Daeron - we have the easiness of an excelent rip and 13 different subtitles at the same place. So, enjoy it! :)\n---------\n\nABOUT SUB:\nEnglish (also .srt), Spanish, French, Russian, Italian, Dutch, Japanese, Swedish, German, Portuguese (also .srt), Hebrew, Chinese &amp; Arabic.\n\nABOUT RIP (quoted from Daeron @KG)\nRipped from French MK2 DVD. Extras included.\n\nOriginally the film was shown in two parts with an intermission in the middle. That's how the movie was on the DVD as well. The first part was on one DVD and the rest on the other. Now the movie is split into 3 CDs to ensure the very good quality. The intermission is between CD#1 and CD#2. That's why CD#2 will start with a &quot;Stalker&quot; text.\n\nNaturally this rip has the original mono audio track, which is better than the new remastered 5.1 audio track.\n\nRussian director Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, an allegorical science fiction film like his earlier Solaris, was adapted from the novel Picnic by the Roadside by brothers Boris Strugatsky and Arkady Strugatsky. The film follows three men -- the Scientist (Nikolai Grinko), the Writer (Anatoliy Solonitsyn), and the Stalker (Alexander Kaidanovsky) -- as they travel through a mysterious and forbidden territory in the Russian wilderness called the &quot;Zone.&quot; In the Zone, nothing is what it seems. Objects change places, the landscape shifts and rearranges itself. It seems as if an unknown intelligence is actively thwarting any attempt to penetrate its borders. In the Zone, there is said to be a bunker, and in the bunker: a magical room which has the power to make wishes come true. The Stalker is the hired guide for the journey who has, through repeated visits to the Zone, become accustomed to its complex traps, pitfalls, and subtle distortions. Only by following his lead (which often involves taking the longest, most frustrating route) can the Writer and the Scientist make it alive to the bunker and the room. As the men travel farther into the Zone, they realize it may take something more than just determination to succeed: it may actually take faith. Increasingly unsure of their deepest desires, they confront the room wondering if they can, in the end, take responsibility for the fulfillment of their own wishes.
