All the songs have a constant bitrate of 192kbps. Well, that's all there is to it. This is directly from Fallout 3. Just listen, relax and enjoy. Yes, these are all the correct artist and song names.\n\t\t\nFor those who are curious, no I'm afraid I don't know who the female vocalist is for the song Let's Go Sunning by Jack Shaindlin. For those who keep claiming that Bob Crosby is incorrect, It is not incorrect, even in the original file name it said Bob Crosby. mus_bobcrosby_happy. That's just an example to prove that it is Bob Crosby and not Bing Crosby. 2 different people but they are brothers and sound nearly alike.\n\nSeed, seed, seed. Upload to other places if you'd like. The more places this gets uploaded to the less chances of it actually dieing and the more people that'll get to enjoy this music.\n\npenguincomrade[at]gmail[dot]com\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYour Friendly Neighbourhood Penguin,\nPenguin Comrade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d20c1117be6c10c121d2b95709bbd6f94288455","amp;dn":"Fallout+3+-+Galaxy+News+Radio+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d20c1117be6c10c121d2b95709bbd6f94288455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,32,193,17,123,230,193,12,18,29,43,149,112,155,189,111,148,40,132,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
