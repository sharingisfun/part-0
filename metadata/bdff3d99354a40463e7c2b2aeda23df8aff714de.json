  "description": "SPECIAL THANKS TO Aelwyn SPECIAL THANKS TO Aelwyn\nBefore downloading please consider the following. this is an update of my previous torrent. some IDIOT claimed that my torrent contained a virus therefore my account and torrents were deleted. I managed to get my account re-opened but i do not have the hashes from my torrents so i cannot recover them. if you decide to download this torrent there are going to be some ground rules.\n\n1. understand that the patch shows up as malicious in some virus scans i.e. a trojan, back-door, virus etc. if it shows up as i stated DO NOT REPORT THIS TORRENT AS HAVING A VIRUS!!!!! unless you actually install and get a virus.\nthe reason that it shows up as malicious is because the patch injects code in order to bypass the activation.\n\n2. This is an extremely large file so you WILL have to seed, also do not limit your upload speeds while downloading. everyone deserves a chance to download at optimum speeds\n\n3. There are always new people in p2p sites such as this one who will from time to time require help. i ask that you either help those who need them or reserve your criticism \n\n4. Understand that once you install the crack and run the application you will always be asked for an activation code. this is normal, always choose to activate later. you will know if that cracked worked or not based on the amount of lessons you can do. if you are unrestricted it worked. if you have limited lessons chances are that you either did not place it in the proper place. or that your anti-virus program is preventing you from using it, or it deleted it.\n\n\nPLEASE SEED TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE DOWNLOADING AND LEAVING. PLEASE ITS NOT MUCH TO ASK SEED! FURTHERMORE I DO NOT DENY ANYBODY HELP. ITS THE LEAST ANYONE CAN DO\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nthe following items are included:\n\nRosetta Stone ver. 3.3.5\nRosetta Stone patch\nGerman v3. lvs. 1,2,3\nItalian v3 lvs. 1,2,3\nchinese (mandarin)v3 lvs. 1,2,3\nFrench v3. lvs. 1,2,3\nJapanese v3. lvs. 1,2,3\nRussian v3 lvs 1,2,3\nSpanish (spain) v3. lvs. 1,2,3\nSpanish (latin america) lvs. 1,2,3\nEnglish (U.S.A) v3 lvs.1,2,3\nArabic v3 lvs. 1,2,3 \nPortuguese v3 lvs. 1,2,3 (with audio companion)\n\nFor Hebrew thank jsir and click here (only levels 1 and 2) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4661405/Rosetta_Stone_Hebrew_V3_Parts_1_AND_2_ISO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4661405/Rosetta_Stone_Hebrew_V3_Parts_1_AND_2_ISO&lt;/a&gt;\n\n Peanut-Lover at 2009-03-01 20:01 CET:\nI thought I posted this before....\n\nArabic Audio comnpanion: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4712819\n\nand the Latin American Spanish - All are of Version 3, in seperate torrents,\nLevel 1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4588618/Rosetta_Stone_Spanish_Latin_American_Level_1_Audio_Companion\nLevel 2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4588208/Rosetta_Stone_Spanish_Latin_American_Level_2_Audio_Companion\nLevel 3: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4589842/Rosetta_Stone_Spanish_Latin_American_Level_3_Audio_Companion\n\n\nyou have the option of downloading the entire torrent, or A subdirectory \n\n-DEIFIED\n\n\nNOOBS: if you are having any problems installing anything check this tutorial that i made just for you, cause gee golly whiz i care :p  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4662881&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4662881&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n                -------------&gt;HOW TO INSTALL&lt;--------------\n\n1. (optional) deactivate your anti-virus. again the crack can be treated as a virus and deleted. if it is deleted you will not be able to unlock the full lessons.\n\n2. open both &quot;Rosetta Stone v3.3.5 for windows&quot; folders. within those folders you will see 2 files, a folder named &quot;crack&quot; and an application named &quot;RosettaStoneSetup.exe&quot;\n\n3. double click the &quot;RosettaStoneSetup.exe&quot; file and install RS. after installation the program will ask you if you would like to launch the application, Say NO\n\n4. close anything that opens and now go back to within the &quot;Rosetta Stone v3.3.5 for windows&quot; folders and open up the &quot;crack&quot; folder\n\n5. you should now see another file named &quot;RosettaStoneVersion3.exe&quot; RIGHT click that file and choose &quot;copy&quot;\n\n6. on your computer go to: Start/My Computer/C drive/program files/rosetta stone/rosetta stone version 3\n\n7. you should see several files. RIGHT click on an empty space within that folder and choose &quot;paste&quot;\n\n8. your computer may notify you that an existing file with the same data already exist, would you like to overwrite it. OVERWRITE IT\n\n9. double click that file you just installed and RS should launch\n\n10. choose to never register and create a profile.\n\n11. NEVER REGISTER THIS SOFTWARE NEVER UPDATE EITHER THE LANGUAGES NOR THE APPLICATION!!!!\n\n12. if you followed the first step then: REACTIVATE YOUR ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAM!!!\n\n\n      -------------------&gt;HOW TO ADD A LANGUAGE&lt;----------------------\n\n1. download and install one of these programs: &quot;magic iso&quot; &quot;power iso&quot; &quot;daemon tools&quot; etc. (you can find them in this website)\n\n2. select a language, like german level 1 for example.\n\n3. RIGHT click on the file (the extension should be .ISO)\n\n4. you should see the program that you installed within that pop-up menu (magic iso for example)\n\n5. drag your mouse over magic iso (or whatever you decided to go with) a new window should pop up. select &quot;mount&quot;\n\n6. after you &quot;mount&quot; the image a new pop-up should appear containing the files within that iso. close that pop-up\n\n7. open rosetta stone and select to &quot;add a language&quot; \n\n8. RS will ask you if it can add 600MB's in your computer. agree\n\n9. And the last and most important step (drum roll)... HAVE FUN :)  &lt;--- thats exactly what i look like in person, dashing aren't i?\n\n\n\n\n              -----                   / -----\n              ----- / TROUBLE SHOOTING  -----\n\n***Rosetta Stone ERROR 1117 SOLUTION(error in speech component)\n  -allow Rosetta Stone access via your firewall.\n\n\n***Rosetta Stone ERROR 2122 SOLUTION (database is out of date)\n  -find and delete the &quot;tracking.db3&quot; file to find this file you must first go into your folder options and enable the view hidden files/folders option\n\n *for XP* go to: Start/My_Computer/C_drive/Documents and Settings/Rosetta Stone\n *for Vista* go to: Start/My_Computer/C_drive/Program_Data/Rosetta Stone\n                           OR\n  Start/My_Computer/C_drive/Documents and Settings/Application_Data/Rosetta Stone\n\n***&quot;Fatal Application Error: #2120&quot;\n\n slamma_jamma_1 at 2008-11-22 06:58 CET:\nwell I got it to work by opening from the rosetta stone folder. The shortcut was giving the error.\nWhat is really strange is that I have &quot;Your Uninstaller! 2008 pro&quot; and it doesnt even show rosetta stone. I have no idea how to uninstall this thing. hehe\n\nThis is a great download BTW :)\n\n\n\nOTHER ISSUES\n\n------------\n                     *****PATCHING ISSUES*****\n\n - some anti-virus programs are hyper active and treat the patch as malicious due to its ability to generate code. first try finding and deleting the &quot;tracking.db3&quot; file read the top ^^ if that doesn't work then:\n                                               \n1.you will have to take a chance and trust me (although i probably wouldn't do the following if somebody told me... )\n2. deactivate your virus scanner TEMPORARILY\n3. on this page click &quot;download this torrent&quot;\n4.when the torrent pops up with the contained files choose &quot;select none&quot; it should be on the right side and center\n5. scroll down to &quot;rosetta stone v3 app and crack and click on the plus sign (+)\n6. do the same for &quot;rosetta stone v.3.3&quot;\n7. put a check on the box next to &quot;rosetta stone v3.3 - patch.exe\n8.download the patch again\n9. install the patch in start/my computer/program files/rosetta stone. and run the patch\n10. AFTER installing the app TURN ON YOUR ANTIVIRUS AGAIN\n\n             ***********PATCH IN USE ERROR*************\n\n Movie_Angel at 2008-11-17 18:57 CET:\nWonderful torrent Deified, I bow to you.\n\nI was having the same problem as doom_doubt. Being told the file was in use and I needed to close it and try again. BUT! Thanks to adm845's suggestion (right click on the folder where you istalled rosetta stone, ie. c:program files(86)rosetta stonerosetta stone v3 go to properties, click the security tab, click edit, then go through the different group or user names, then click on &quot;full control&quot; for each one. This should allow you to install the patch without getting the &quot;file in use&quot; error message--this works for Vista as well as XP), I am now running Rosetta Stone v.3.2 on BOTH my XP desktop and Vista desktop. This is why I love places like this...at least when we all try to help each other enjoy the applications we take time to upload/download.",
