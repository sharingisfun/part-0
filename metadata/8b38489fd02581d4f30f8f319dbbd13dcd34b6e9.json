  "description": "TITLE/EDITION The Oxford Illustrated History of the First World War: New Edition\nBy: Hew Strachan \nSeries: Oxford Illustrated Histories\nHardcover: 400 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press; New edition (May 19, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0199663386\nISBN-13: 978-0199663385\nNOTE: This is the standalone ebook and may not include access codes that come packaged with the bound book\n\n\n\n\nThe First World War, now a century ago, still shapes the world in which we live, and its legacy lives on, in poetry, in prose, in collective memory and political culture. By the time the war ended in 1918, millions lay dead. Three major empires lay shattered by defeat, those of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. A fourth, Russia, was in the throes of a revolution that helped define the rest of the twentieth century. \n\nThe Oxford History of the First World War brings together in one volume many of the most distinguished historians of the conflict, in an account that matches the scale of the events. From its causes to its consequences, from the Western Front to the Eastern, from the strategy of the politicians to the tactics of the generals, they chart the course of the war and assess its profound political and human consequences. Chapters on economic mobilization, the impact on women, the role of propaganda, and the rise of socialism establish the wider context of the fighting at sea and in the air, and which ranged on land from the trenches of Flanders to the mountains of the Balkans and the deserts of the Middle East. \n\nFirst published for the 90th anniversary of the 1918 Armistice, this highly illustrated revised edition contains significant new material to mark the 100th anniversary of the war's outbreak",
