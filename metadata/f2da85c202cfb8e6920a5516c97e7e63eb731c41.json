B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice \nand Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which \nis titled A Game of Thrones. Filmed in a Belfast studio and on location \nelsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Scotland, Croatia, Iceland and Morocco, \nit premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011. The series was \nrenewed for a fourth season, to debut on April 6, 2014.\n\nSeven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. \nPolitical and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, \nasks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest \nofficial. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts \nin order to investigate further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, \nmay be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the \nprevious and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain \nthe throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and \nwith the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to \nfull-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. \nAmidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, \nthe Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors \nbeyond.\n\nContainer.......: mkv\nFile Size.......: 10,58 GB (361 MB per episode) - Episodes\n                  841 MB - Bonus Features\nVideo...........: resolution 720x400 (16:9, x264, 750 kbps)\nAudio 1.........: 2.0 channels (aac, 128 kbps)\nAudio 2,3.......: 1.0 channels (mp3, 32 kbps - commentaries)\nAudio Language..: English / Dothraki / Valyrian\nFrame Rate......: 25,00 fps\nSource..........: DVD Box Set (PAL)\nBonus Features..: Included*\nSamples.........: Yes\n\n* There are 31 optional audio commentaries (described in commentaries.txt.)\n\nSoft-Coded Subs.: \n\nALL 3 SEASONS...: English (for non-English dialogue only) (separate .srt files)\n                  \nSEASON 1........: English, French, Spanish, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Dutch,\n                  Croatian, Danish, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Norwegian, Portuguese,\n                  Romanian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish (VobSub)\n\nSEASON 2........: English, French, Spanish, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Dutch,\n                  Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian,\n                  Serbian, Swedish, Turkish (VobSub)\n\nSEASON 3........: English, French, Spanish, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Dutch,\n                  Danish, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Norwegian, Portuguese,\n                  Romanian, Serbian, Swedish, Turkish (VobSub)\n\nBONUS FEATURES..: English (VobSub)  \n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaMmfAAfh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaMmfAAfh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jaMMGaaFh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jaMMGaaFh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAmmhAAfh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAmmhAAfh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jamMlAafh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jamMlAafh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAmmIaAFh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAmmIaAFh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAMmjAAfH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JAMmjAAfH&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEPISODE LIST:\n\nSEASON 1\n\nS01E01 Winter Is Coming\nS01E02 The Kingsroad\nS01E03 Lord Snow\nS01E04 Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things\nS01E05 The Wolf and the Lion\nS01E06 A Golden Crown\nS01E07 You Win or You Die\nS01E08 The Pointy End\nS01E09 Baelor\nS01E10 Fire and Blood\n\nSEASON 2\n\nS02E01 The North Remembers\nS02E02 The Night Lands\nS02E03 What Is Dead May Never Die\nS02E04 Garden of Bones\nS02E05 The Ghost of Harrenhal\nS02E06 The Old Gods and the New\nS02E07 A Man Without Honor\nS02E08 The Prince of Winterfell\nS02E09 Blackwater\nS02E10 Valar Morghulis\n\nSEASON 3\n\nS03E01 Valar Dohaeris\nS03E02 Dark Wings, Dark Words\nS03E03 Walk of Punishment\nS03E04 And Now His Watch Is Ended\nS03E05 Kissed by Fire\nS03E06 The Climb\nS03E07 The Bear and the Maiden Fair\nS03E08 Second Sons\nS03E09 The Rains of Castamere\nS03E10 Mhysa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2da85c202cfb8e6920a5516c97e7e63eb731c41","amp;dn":"Game+Of+Thrones+Complete+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3+x264+%2B+Extras+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2da85c202cfb8e6920a5516c97e7e63eb731c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,218,133,194,2,207,184,230,146,10,85,22,201,126,126,99,235,115,28,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
