Through the simplicity of their lifestyle those who live there are a real step ahead of us: they spend their time concentrating their knowledge, strength and energy on the development of their minds and bodies in a natural environment which they dearly preserve and care for. Once a year, they gather in the crater of a dormant volcano to decide which planets they ought to send messengers to. There are volunteers for every planet except Earth, which is considered too polluted and too dangerous. One woman alone, Mila, decides to go there to seek out her identity, as Osam the old sage has revealed to her that she was conceived there during a previous trip by her father.\n- Written by Polly_Kat -\n\nSource-------- genuine French DVD (unlike other releases floating around)\nReleased------ 2014/02/17\nFormat-------- Matroska/h264\nFile size----- 990 MB\nLength-------- 1:29:53\nVideo Bit rate ~1.4 MBps\nDisplay AR---- 1023/444 ( 2.35:1 )\nFrame rate---- 23.976 fps\nAudio--------- FRE DD 2.0 @192KBps\nSubtitles----- Eng, Bul, Cze, Dut, Est, Gre, Hun, Pt-br, Rom, Slvn, Spa, Srp\nScreens------ &lt;a href=&quot; http://imgbox.com/g/7tZpncrtgJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imgbox.com/g/7tZpncrtgJ&lt;/a&gt;\nEncoder------- HighCode\n\nNote: Only EngSub was on DVD, \nnevertheless I corrected and improved time-stamps on all subs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad2eb153d122aaa5044a77b4af3946c0933c2db","amp;dn":"La+Belle+Verte+1996+%28The+Green+Beautiful%29+DvdRip+x264-HighCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad2eb153d122aaa5044a77b4af3946c0933c2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,210,235,21,61,18,42,170,80,68,167,123,74,243,148,108,9,51,194,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
