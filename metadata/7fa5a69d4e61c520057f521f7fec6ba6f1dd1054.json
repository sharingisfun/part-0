  "description": "The Pretenders\nGreatest Hits (2000)\n\nOver the years, the Pretenders became a vehicle for guitarist/vocalist Chrissie Hynde's songwriting, yet it was a full-fledged band when it was formed in the late '70s. With their initial records, the group crossed the bridge between punk/new wave and Top 40 pop more than any other band, recording a series of hard, spiky singles that were also melodic and immediately accessible. Hynde was an invigorating, sexy singer who bent the traditional male roles of rock &amp; roll to her own liking, while guitarist James Honeyman-Scott created a sonic palette filled with suspended chords, effects pedals, and syncopated rhythms that proved remarkably influential over the next two decades. After Honeyman-Scott's death, the Pretenders became a more straightforward rock band, yet Hynde's semi-autobiographical songwriting and bracing determination meant that the group never became just another rock band, even when their music became smoother and more pop-oriented.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Brass In Pocket\n02.Message Of Love\n03.Don't Get Me Wrong\n04.Kid\n05.Human (Tin Tin Out Remix)\n06.I Go To Sleep\n07.Forever Young\n08.I Got You Babe (With UB40)\n09.Night In My Veins\n10.Spiritual High (State Of Independence)\n11.Talk Of The Town\n12.Stop Your Sobbing\n13.Hymn To Her\n14.2000 Miles\n15.Breakfast In Bed\n16.Popstar\n17.Middle Of The Road\n18.Thin Line Between Love And Hate\n19.Back On The Chain Gang\n20.I'll Stand By You\n\n\nCheers!",
