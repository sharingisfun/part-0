  "description": "Newsweek | 1973 | Pdf | Eng | ISBN10 0882250280 | 170 pag | 31.3 MB\n\nSome 140 illustrationsÃ¢â‚¬â€more than one third in full colorÃ¢â‚¬â€supplement this absorbing history of Italy's fabled lagoon city. Works by every major Venetian artist are reproduced in color, and the text is further complemented by numerous modern photographs especially taken for this volume by Adam Woolfitt, the noted English photographer.\n\nTHE MOST TRIUMPHANT CITY I ever set eyes on, &quot;a French visitor exclaimed upon reaching Venice in 1495. Few contemporaries would have disputed the man's assessment, for during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries La Serenissima, the Most Serene Republic of Venice, was mistress of the entire Mediterranean. The wealth of the Orient sluiced through her canals, and her merchant princes amassed fortunes that exceeded those of many European kings",
