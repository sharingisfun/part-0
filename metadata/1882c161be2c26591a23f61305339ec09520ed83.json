The Ocean (Working Mix)\n\nLed Zeppelin launched a massive, Jimmy Page- supervised reissue campaign in 2014, where each of their studio albums was remastered and then expanded with a bonus disc of alternate versions.\n\nThe supplemental disc for Houses of the Holy is constructed as a mirror image of the finished album, consisting of nothing but alternate mixes and sometimes instrumentals. The cuts without vocals are the most compelling: on Ã¢â‚¬Å“No Quarter,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to hear Zeppelin build their sense of mystery and by stripping Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Song Remains the SameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Over the Hills and Far AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to nothing but six strings, admiration for how Jimmy Page assembled his guitar army only grows. Elsewhere, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Rain SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to float as lithely and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Crunge,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dancing DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The OceanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ all feel leaner, relying on tight propulsion instead of a Technicolor onslaught. Such differences are interesting but, as with the accompanying bonus disc to IV, this Houses of the Holy supplement ultimately confirms that Page and Zeppelin made the right choices the first time around.\n\n\n\nHouses of the Holy follows the same basic pattern as Led Zeppelin IV, but the approach is looser and more relaxed. Jimmy PageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riffs rely on ringing, folky hooks as much as they do on thundering blues-rock, giving the album a lighter, more open atmosphere. While the pseudo-reggae of Ã¢â‚¬Å“DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Yer MakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢erÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the affectionate James Brown send-up Ã¢â‚¬Å“The CrungeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ suggest that the band was searching for material, they actually contribute to the musical diversity of the album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Rain SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of ZepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest moments, featuring a soaring string arrangement and a gentle, aching melody. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The OceanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is just as good, starting with a heavy, funky guitar groove before slamming into an a cappella section and ending with a swinging, doo wop-flavored rave-up. With the exception of the rampaging opening number, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Song Remains the Same,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the rest of Houses of the Holy is fairly straightforward, ranging from the foreboding Ã¢â‚¬Å“No QuarterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the strutting hard rock of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dancing DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the epic folk/metal fusion Ã¢â‚¬Å“Over the Hills and Far Away.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Throughout the record, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playing is excellent, making the eclecticism of Page and Robert PlantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting sound coherent and natural.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]",
