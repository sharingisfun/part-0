They formed in 1968, and comprised lead Russell Thompkins, Jr., Herbie Murrell, Airrion Love, James Smith, and James Dunn.According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine at Allmusic, &quot;after The Spinners and The O'Jays, the Stylistics were the leading Philly soul group produced by Thom Bell&quot;.Equally, &quot;of all their peers, the Stylistics were one of the smoothest and sweetest soul groups of their era. All of their U.S. hits were graced by the soaring falsetto of Russell Thompkins, Jr. and the lush yet graceful productions of Bell, which helped make the Stylistics one of the most successful soul groups of the first half of the 1970s.&quot;During the early 1970s, the band had twelve straight U.S. R&amp;B top ten hits, including &quot;You Are Everything&quot;, &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot;, &quot;I'm Stone in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Break Up to Make Up&quot;, and &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;.\n                                                        text from  wikipedia\n\n\n\n  1.
