The performance-packed live production featured a wealth of varied material from his career to date and a generous bonus disc.\n\nMorse, Portnoy and George returned to the studio for a change in direction, recording the non-conceptual, song-oriented Lifeline in 2008, and once again he embarked on a tour featuring his European band stretching out and covering more material from SpockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Beard, Transatlantic and as well as his latest solo material. 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s triple CD, So Many Roads chronicles the live performances and the whopping 29 tracks serve as a definitive overview of MorseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vast and varied work.\n\nAlthough prog fans were warmly embracing NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo output, many held out hope for years that the Transtlantic blimp would fly again. In 2009, their dream became reality as the four regrouped to morph NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demo, &quot;The Whirlwind&quot; into a new team composition. It went on to be the group's highest charting album to date, and in 2010, Transatlantic embarked on their biggest tour yet, with dates in 11 nations across Europe and North America. The impressive and successful tour was immortalized in both the double-live DVD, Whirld Tour 2010 and massive 3CD/2DVD box set More Never Is Enough.\n\nFollowing the Transatlantic run, Morse, Portnoy and George returned to record the sequel to NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first progressive, faith-based epic. In 2011, the double disc Testimony 2 was released to critical acclaim, this time including guest appearances by old SpockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Beard band mates and some clever musical reprises that respectfully give a nod to the original Testimony material.\n\nTrying something new, Morse put his hand to a different kind of writing, authoring his self-published autobiography appropriately titled, Testimony. The fascinating account revealed the albumsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ back story and fleshed out more personal details of his spiritual journey from frustration and despair to hope and joy. A German translation and e-edition of the book were soon developed.\n\nMorse took the show on the road again, playing in the US and overseas to wildly enthusiastic crowds who were thrilled to see most of the original Testimony tour band playing together again. Released in 2011, the Testimony 2: Live in Los Angeles 3CD/2DVD box set reveals the joy and spirit of that tour. Morse also released Sing It High, a songbook featuring 15 songs written out with melody lines, lyrics and chords.\n\nNews soon leaked out about MorseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement in another supergroup, but one decidedly more pop than prog. This one also featured Portnoy, along with the legendary axe man Steve Morse (Dixie Dregs, Deep Purple), Dave Larue and a relatively unknown singer/songwriter named Casey McPherson. Initial recordings took place in January 2011, and a year later, Flying ColorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ self-title debut surfaced, garnering sweeping praise and supported by a brief tour in September 2012. A live DVD is currently in production to be released some time in 2013.\n\nPraying for guidance for his next solo effort, Morse sensed God leading him to keep moving forward in the direction he was heading, so he reconvened with Portnoy, George and friends to record 2012Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Momentum, featuring blistering guitar work by Paul Gilbert and contributions from his new touring band assembled through a fascinating YouTube audition process. The hand-picked new ensemble delivered jaw-dropping performances with an invigorating spirit, making the Momentum tour an undisputed success that was skillfully caught on video with the 2DVD/3CD box set, Live Momentum. Due to demand, a Blu-Ray edition was also released.\n\nAs of spring 2013, work is underway for new Transatlantic and Flying Colors recordings. To the delight of his passionate and growing fan base, there seems to be no end in sight for the magical music and masterful musicianship that flows from the mind and hands of Neal Morse.\n\n\nThe Neal Morse Band Official Site\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 The Grand Experiment (Special Edition)\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1:\n\n1.

He had no prepared material at all. Neal comments, &quot;I wanted to see what it would be like to create freely in the room with no preconceived notions. It was quite a risk!&quot; On previous albums, like the Testimony album for example, Morse had the entire album written in advance.\n\n&quot;I used to be rather paranoid about whether things would turn out in the short space of time we had available...so I would fill all the space in advance!&quot; This album was totally different. &quot;I made a lot of room for the other guys to create and express themselves and the result is outstanding! We wanted to experiment, do something a bit different, and see what everyone is capable of...we found out...in SPADES!&quot; The results are obvious! This was a &quot;grand experiment&quot; that produced something far beyond anyone's expectations!\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre: Progressive\nSubgenre: Progressive Rock\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 243.13 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n10 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d4eb9cf2df4164a4c405bc2c4d4724690504490","amp;dn":"The+Neal+Morse+Band-+The+Grand+Experiment+%28Special+Edition%29+%28201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d4eb9cf2df4164a4c405bc2c4d4724690504490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,78,185,207,45,244,22,74,76,64,91,194,196,212,114,70,144,80,68,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
