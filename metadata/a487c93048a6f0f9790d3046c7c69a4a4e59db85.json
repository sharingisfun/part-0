  "description": "The End of Imagination by Arundhati Roy\r\nEnglish | 2016 | ISBN: 1608466191 | 390 pages | EPUB | 2 MB\r\n\r\nThe End of Imagination brings together five of Arundhati Roy's acclaimed books of essays into one comprehensive volume for the first time and features a new introduction by the author.\r\n\r\nThis new collection begins with her pathbreaking book The Cost of Livingâ€”published soon after she won the Booker Prize for her novel The God of Small Thingsâ€”in which she forcefully condemned IndiaÃ¢Â€â„¢s nuclear tests and its construction of enormous dam projects that continue to displace countless people from their homes and communities. The End of Imagination also includes her nonfiction works Power Politics, War Talk, Public Power in the Age of Empire, and An Ordinary PersonÃ¢Â€â„¢s Guide to Empire, which include her widely circulated and inspiring writings on the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the need to confront corporate power, and the hollowing out of democratic institutions globally",
