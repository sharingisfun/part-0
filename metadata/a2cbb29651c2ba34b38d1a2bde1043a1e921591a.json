However, after planning the huge party and as Anna is being led on a &quot;party treasure hunt,&quot; Elsa finds that she has caught a cold. She starts sneezing and produces a group of small, cute snow people, much like Olaf, with each sneeze. After some near-misses, a very exhausted Elsa finally makes it with Anna to the courtyard where the party has been arranged. It is a big hit, and at last Anna manages to convince Elsa into letting her to lead her to bed and take care of her. Meanwhile, Olaf has taken the tiny snow creatures under his wing and takes them to Elsa's ice castle with the help of Kristoff.\n\nDirectors: Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee\nWriters: Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee\nStars: Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff\nGenres: Animation | Short | Adventure | Comedy | Fantasy\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\n\n\nRELEASE: Frozen.Fever.2015.BDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO                                             \n\nSOURCE: Full-Bluray (US) - Thank you friend!                                               \n\nViDEO: 6003 kbps XviD               \n\nRESOLUTiON: 720x320                           \n\nRUNTiME: 00h07m57sec      \n\nSUBTiTLES: N/A                               \n\nAUDiO: 448 CBR AC-3        \n\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \n\nGREETS: Srkfan &amp; AQOS \n\nNOTES: Got so many requests to get this, well, here is it.
