  "description": "avast! Internet Security 2014\n\nYour all-inclusive protection.\nOur top-selling suite secures your data, identity, and sensitive financial transactions in its unique SafeZone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and keeps hackers out with its Firewall.\n\nOnline or offline, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re totally secure\n\nSecure your financial transactions.\n\nPrevent having your credit card or online banking data hacked and your money stolen. Use SafeZone, an Internet Security feature that secures sensitive transactions. Set your favorite banking or shopping sites to automatically launch SafeZone to ensure that all of your sensitive financial transactions stay private.\n\nMake your computer a data fortress\n\nYour private data shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be available to anyone but you. So the silent firewall in Internet Security blocks hackers from stealing sensitive personal data from your PC. This new version was rebuilt to make faster decisions, work even better with Windows, and fully support IPv6.\n\nSay &quot;Goodbye&quot; to spam &amp; phishing scams\n\nThe majority of spam includes harmful Ã¢â‚¬ËœphishingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ links built specifically to exploit your PC or credit card data. This type of phishing email tries to convince you itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from a legitimate sender. Our anti-spam technology filters out such nuisances to save your time and protect you from potential headaches.\n\nDid it break? Fix it!\nIf anything nasty happens to your computer and some malware blocks access to your avast!, you fortunately were able to create an image of your avast! setup on a USB stick or CD/DVD ahead of time, which will help you restore the PC to its normal functions.\n\nIntelligent antivirus, anti-spyware, &amp; anti-malware\nNot just a marketing phrase! Our DynaGen-powered antivirus streams hundreds of tiny real-time updates to your PCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virus database each day, to catch new malware faster. Its decisions are based on artificial intelligence that works inside the algorithm responsible for analyzing suspicious files.\n\nRun shady files in a virus-proof environment\nUnsure if the file you just downloaded is safe? Run it in the Sandbox, a virtual environment where you can run even the most heavily infected files safely. But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safe anyway, with our FileRep (file-reputation scanning) technology.\n\nOur crowd in the cloud\navast! CommunityIQ is one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fastest signature-based malware data sources. This early warning system is based on data from tens of millions of our customers who Ã¢â‚¬â€œ anonymously Ã¢â‚¬â€œ share any new pieces of malware they encounter.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nYou need at least Windows XP (with SP2) installed. Windows Vista, 7, 8, and even 8.1 are fully supported (unless your device runs the Starter or RT edition) in both the 32- and 64-bit variant. A 10-year old Pentium 3 processor will do, with 128 MB RAM and 600 MB of hard-drive space. And now imagine the stellar performance with your new hardware!\n\nHomepage: http://www.avast.com/index\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given key (lic).\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.",
