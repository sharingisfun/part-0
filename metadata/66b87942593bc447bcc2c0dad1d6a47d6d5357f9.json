  "description": "A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by British rock group Queen, released in November 1975. Co-produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was, at the time of its release, the most expensive album ever recorded. A commercial success, A Night at the Opera has been voted by the public and cited by music publications as one of Queen's finest works.\n\nThe album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film A Night at the Opera, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording.[2] It was originally released by EMI in the UK, where it topped the charts for four non-consecutive weeks, and Elektra Records in the US, where it peaked at number 4.\n\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)&quot;    Mercury \t3:43\n02. \t&quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon&quot;   \tMercury \t1:08\n03. \t&quot;I'm in Love with My Car&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t3:05\n04. \t&quot;You're My Best Friend&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t2:50\n05. \t&quot;'39&quot;   \tBrian May \t3:25\n06. \t&quot;Sweet Lady&quot;   \tMay \t4:01\n07. \t&quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;   \tMercury \t2:13\n08. \t&quot;The Prophet's Song&quot;   \tMay \t8:17\n09. \t&quot;Love of My Life&quot;   \tMercury \t3:38\n10. \t&quot;Good Company&quot;   \tMay \t3:26\n11. \t&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;   \tMercury \t5:55\n12. \t&quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (Instrumental) \tTraditional, arr.
