WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just about two weeks away from beginning to offer Windows 10 to the world, as Terry detailed here. Over the past few days weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been preparing our release pipelines and processes, and this build is one step closer to what customers will start to receive on 7/29. For example, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice with this build that the desktop watermark is no longer there (you can still do Search &gt; Winver to see your version number.\n\nOn Monday we announced that builds from here on will only be available through Windows Update, so to get this one you can either wait and it will be installed automatically (but who are we kidding, I know you want it now!) or go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. Remember that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to be logged in with your Microsoft Account in order to receive the build.\n\nBesides builds, over the next 2 weeks youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also see some Windows Updates and app updates in the Store, so make sure to keep checking for updates daily to make sure youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re running the latest and greatest code.\n\nMicrosoft Edge is blazing fast!\n\nThe Edge team has been continuing to optimize performance since first adding the new browser to Windows 10. In this build, Microsoft Edge is even better and is beating Chrome and Safari on their own JavaScript benchmarks:\n\nOn WebKit Sunspider, Edge is 112% faster than Chrome\nOn Google Octane, Edge is 11% faster than Chrome\nOn Apple JetStream, Edge is 37% faster than Chrome\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really pleased with those performance gains and we hope that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy faster browsing with Microsoft Edge along with the many great features weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added over the last several builds.\n\nWindows 10 App Development\n\nDevelopers working on Windows 10 will have the first opportunity to upload Universal Windows Applications to the Windows Dev Center using production quality Windows 10 tools on July 29th. We appreciate all the time youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve spent using flights of the tools and providing feedback and we are excited for you to begin sharing your applications with everyone running Windows 10. For more information on developing Universal Windows Apps, see the Building Apps For Windows blog.\n\nOffice on Windows 10\n\nThanks to all of you who have been using the new Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps on Windows 10. There are a few changes to the apps coming up that are part of helping them get ready for their release with Windows 10. You may have already noticed that on PCs and tablets weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added Ã¢â‚¬Å“MobileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the app names (to help distinguish them from the Office desktop suite), while on phones we simply call the apps Word, Excel and PowerPoint. We will also remove Ã¢â‚¬Å“PreviewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the app names and in about one week, you will need an Office 365 subscription to edit on Windows 10 PCs and larger tablets.\n\nSimilar to what we announced in March, viewing and most editing will remain free for non-commercial use on devices of 10.1Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or less. Otherwise, you will need a qualifying Office 365 subscription. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have an Office 365 subscription, you can sign up for a free trial at www.office.com/try. You can also always edit your documents for free in Office Online at www.office.com. The full featured OneNote Universal App will come installed with Windows 10 and similar to OneNote on all other devices, editing is free.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting close!\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all working super hard here to deliver the best Windows ever, and are preparing everything that needs to be in place for our public release. We cannot wait for all of you, and your friends and family who reserved their upgrade, to see the result.\n\nThis is going to be an exciting couple of weeks, but it is also only the beginning. Windows as a service means that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll continue to keep Windows up to date with improvements and features, and our Windows Insider Program will continue so you can get early builds and share your feedback with us.\n\nStay tuned for more news about our launch activities, and at least one fun surprise for Windows Insiders coming up!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efbbd6523c0f3217805d91272577a7deedab2460","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Pro+Build+10240+STA1-TH1+En-us+x86+By%3AWhiteDeath%5BTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efbbd6523c0f3217805d91272577a7deedab2460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,187,214,82,60,15,50,23,128,93,145,39,37,119,167,222,237,171,36,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
