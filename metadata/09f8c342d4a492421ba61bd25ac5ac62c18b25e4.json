If you think he\ndoes, then that's your loss, I'm afraid. Go hit Google, you philistine!\n\n&quot;Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy - The Complete Trilogy Of Five&quot; is the full, official title of this 25 disc box set, commercially released in December of 2007.\n\nThe set features all five books in the Hitchhiker's series:\n\n- Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy (disc 1 - 5)\n- The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe (disc 6 - 10)\n- Life, The Universe And Everything (disc 11 - 15)\n- So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish (disc 16 - 19)\n- Mostly Harmless (disc 20 - 25)\n\nAll were read by Martin Freeman (of The Office fame) who also starred in the recent motion picture version of the book; except the first book, which is read by actor Stephen Fry (Who, coincidentally was also in the flim, as 'The Book').\n\nThese versions of the books were recorded in 2005/2006, and are (according to the sleeve) mostly unabridged.\n\nFor the most part there are no chapter markers on the discs, and thus the tracklist below don't list chapters either.",
