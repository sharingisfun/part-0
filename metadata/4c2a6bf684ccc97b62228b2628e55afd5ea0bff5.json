It allows you to play stereoÃ‚Â­scopic videos and DVDs (external decoder required) and also allows you to watch live video from a capture device. Since it is based on DirectÃ‚Â­Show, it can handle almost any media format, for example AVI, MPEG, WMV, ASF and MOV. Videos can be coded in several different stereoÃ‚Â­scopic formats. For the most popular 3D-DVDs and 3D video files, Stereoscopic Player can even retrieve the proper settings from a web server. If you are creating content yourself, you can ship your video files together with a Stereoscopic Metafile (*.svi), which also eliminates the need to specify the input format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c2a6bf684ccc97b62228b2628e55afd5ea0bff5","amp;dn":"Stereoscopic+Player+v2.0.7+Final+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c2a6bf684ccc97b62228b2628e55afd5ea0bff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,42,107,246,132,204,201,123,98,34,139,38,40,229,90,253,94,160,191,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
