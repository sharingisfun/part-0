Key released a limited version for the PC on April 28, 2004, and the regular version less than four months later on August 8, 2004. The visual novel was later ported to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Xbox 360. The gameplay in Clannad follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters.\n\nWhile both of Key's first two previous works, Kanon and Air, had been released first as adult games and then censored for the younger market, Key's third work Clannad was released for all ages and does not contain risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© situations or even any fan service. On November 25, 2005, Key released an adult spin-off entitled Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life which expands the scenario of Tomoyo Sakagami, one of the five heroines from Clannad.\n\nAdditional info: The game is ready to play ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ just install it.  The english localisation is merged into the installation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6664348f85e2788e261061aac8e0761553f4aefb","amp;dn":"CLANNAD+Full+Voice+%28English+Version%21%29+%5BVisual+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6664348f85e2788e261061aac8e0761553f4aefb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,100,52,143,133,226,120,142,38,16,97,170,200,224,118,21,83,244,174,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
