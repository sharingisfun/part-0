I'll use this repack as my index as opposed to my previous Sims 4 repack ...\n\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nIf u already had any version of Sims 4 installed, uninstall it and make sure there is no 'The Sims 4' folder in (My) DocumentsElectronic Arts directory after uninstalling the game. (Backup your saves and make sure no registry keys are left from previous Sims 4 game )\n\nDISABLE YOUR ANTIVIRUS BEFORE RUNNING SETUP (IMPORTANT) ,, same for uninstall.....(For avast users: Just Disable DeepScreen in antivirus settings)...\n\nAfter running setup,, click on 'Configure',, specify the install directory,, click on next and next,, select the necessary software (Direct X,visual c++ x86,visual c++ x64[not for x86 users] ,, again next,, finally on 'Install'....\n\nADD THE SIMS 4 GAME FOLDER TO THE EXCLUSION/EXCEPTION LIST OF YOUR ANTIVIRUS OTHERWISE YOUR ANTIVIRUS WILL CHANGE THE 'TS4.exe' FILE INTO A TEMPORARY FILE OR JUST DELETE IT WHICH WON'T LET THE GAME TO RUN, AFTER THIS STEP, YOU CAN ENABLE YOUR ANTIVIRUS....\n\nPlay the game from DESKTOP SHORTCUT or install directory. ALWAYS OPEN THE GAME USING RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR ....\n\nTIPS:\n\n -If u have Origin installed and play the game with it enabled, then the DLCs will get disabled , completely exit origin and then play the game ...\n\n -If the game asks for Origin to be running , then it means your antivirus has blocked the crack, it's advised to create an exception for The Sims 4 folder to avoid this, make sure u have taken care of Windows Defender apart from your primary antivirus .... \n\n -Don't skip instally both vcredist_x86 and vcredist_x64 updates ....\n\nIf it still crashes, lower the graphics settings from options ingame and make sure you meet the system requirements. There is a 'laptop mode' for running it on low end laptops. I run it on a laptop on ultra settings without this mode. It's much better optimised than Sims 3.\n\nDon't download any cracks or open links from unknown people in comments section. That can surely harm your PC....\n\nIF U R STILL UNABLE TO GET IT WORKING, INBOX ME AT KICKASS OR ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE ....\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE REPACK,, GIVE FEEDBACK AND SEED.......\n\nLIKE THE GAME,, BUY IT AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS.......\n\nCheck out my Official facebook page &quot;Mr DJ repacks&quot;\nLike it guys to support and get updates on upcoming repacks",
