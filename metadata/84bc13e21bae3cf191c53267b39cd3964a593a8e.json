Use the Advanced Spill Suppressor to control the amount of green spill left in green-screen footage.\n\nLive Text Templates for Premiere Pro - Package your After Effects compositions as Live Text templates so Premiere Pro editors can change the text without changing the text color, motion, or lower-third background.\n\nFlexible masking options and Premiere Pro Interchange - Use masks to apply effects to specific areas of your compositions Ã¢â‚¬â€ no need for additional adjustment or track matte layers and blend each effect individually into the original layer. Import masks from Premiere Pro via Dynamic Link for further refinement.\n\nKuler integration - Create color themes using the Adobe Kuler app on your iPhone or in your browser, and then sync your swatches to After Effects for use in your compositions.\n\nMercury Transmit - Get full-screen previews of your composites on a separate monitor. Send previews over interfaces like HDMI from a graphics card without additional hardware.\n\nMedia Browser enhancements - Navigate your media locally or across a network via Adobe Anywhere, and access complex media types like P2 and XDCAM as media, not as nested folders.\n\nTypekit Integration - Access a variety of fonts from Typekit for immediate use in your After Effects projects.\n\nPanel Integration support - Find and install plug-ins, extensions, training media, and other content via After Effects panels created by the developer community.\n\nAnd so much more - Also includes: Faster performance in the Warp Stabilizer VFX effect; the ability to import Sony RAW footage from F5, F55, and F65 cameras; scripting access to render settings and output module settings; and more.\n\nSee full release notes:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://creativedojo.net/whats-new-adobe-effects-cc-2014/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://creativedojo.net/whats-new-adobe-effects-cc-2014/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n-Intel Core2 Duo or AMD Phenom II processor with 64-bit support\n-Microsoft Windows 7 with Service Pack 1, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1\n-4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)\n-5 GB of available hard-disk space; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on removable flash storage devices)\n-Additional disk space for disk cache (10 GB recommended)\n-1280 x 1080 display\n-OpenGL 2.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œcapable system\n-QuickTime 7.6.6 software required for QuickTime features\n-Optional: Adobe-certifi ed GPU card for GPU-accelerated ray-traced 3D renderer\n\nLanguages : Deutsch, English, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, FranÃƒÂ§ais, Italiano, PortuguÃƒÂªs (Brasil), ÃÂ Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹, Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¨ÂªÅ¾, Ã­â€¢Å“ÃªÂµÂ­Ã¬â€“Â´\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84bc13e21bae3cf191c53267b39cd3964a593a8e","amp;dn":"Adobe+After+Effects+CC+2014+13.0.1+%2864+bit%29+%28patch%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84bc13e21bae3cf191c53267b39cd3964a593a8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,188,19,226,27,174,60,241,145,197,50,103,179,156,211,150,74,89,58,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
