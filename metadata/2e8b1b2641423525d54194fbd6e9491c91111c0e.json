  "description": "The White Stripes\nThe Best Of The White Stripes (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nthe White Stripes formed on Bastille Day in 1997, aiming to create simple, vigorous rock &amp; roll with little more than Meg White's percussion and Jack White's guitar-and-vocal attack. Meg's drumming was deliberate and straightforward, while Jack's formidable guitar skills paid homage to garage rock, blues, and punk. A former drummer for the Detroit-based country outfit Goober &amp; the Peas, he also displayed an affinity for American folk music, and the White Stripes took strength in the varied interests of its two members. Moreover, the group bolstered its sound with a controversial backstory (although the bandmates claimed to be siblings, they were actually a married couple until 2000) and a unique color scheme, which saw their clothing and cover art adhering to a red-and-white peppermint candy motif. \n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audiochecker, Accurip Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Jimmy The Exploder\n02.The Big Three Killed My Baby\n03.Sugar Never Tasted So Good\n04.Do\n05.You're Pretty Good Looking (For A Girl)\n06.Hello Operator\n07.Apple Blossom\n08.Sister, Do You Know My Name\n09.Let's Build A Home\n10.Dead Leaves And The Dirty Ground\n11.Hotel Yorba\n12.Fell In Love With A Girl\n13.We're Going To Be Friends\n14.Seven Nation Army\n15.Black Math\n16.In The Cold, Cold, Night\n17.The Hardest Button To Button\n18.Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\n19.Blue Orchid\n20.My Doorbell\n21.Forever For Her (Is Over For Me)\n22.Take, Take, Take\n23.I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet)\n24.Icky Thump\n25.You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)\n26.Conquest\n27.Little Cream Soda\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers",
