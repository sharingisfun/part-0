All methods and programs personally verified by us many times and we can safely recommend them to you.\r\n\r\n! All programs must be run as administrator!\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n- If you have a direct hand, you want to activate in the Off-line mode and no longer bother to search for keys every six months, then you are prepared activation via firmware BIOS. But be careful, because if your not the right things, you have a chance to bungle the operation and will have to contact the service center. And keep in mind that for every BIOS (AMI, Award, Phoenix) has its own specific program (AMI - amitool, etc.), what is your BIOS can see when you boot the computer.\r\n\r\n- If you do not want to make any changes either in your &quot;iron&quot;, or in the Windows itself, and that your activation is not distinguished by anything from legal activation, your choice of KMS server. With the use of virtual machines, this method can also be called Off-line. But you should know that this method of activation for six months and 180 days, you again have to repeat it. Also, this method only and Professional version Enterprise\r\n\r\n- If you did not accept neither the first nor the second of our suggested methods you can use the activators. Without going into too much detail, we can say that activators emulate the BIOS with slicom 2.1. But no one gives a guarantee that Microsoft will not release a patch or update that will detect the presence of emulation and reset the activation. We recommend to start with Windows 7 Activator Loader eXtreme Edition (Napalum), because He has a huge number of settings and features and good will activate automatically\r\n\r\nList of programs\r\nâ€¢ ODIN 1.3.7 by secr9tos\r\nâ€¢ RemoveWAT Uninstall\r\nâ€¢ Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3.503\r\nâ€¢ Windows Loader v2.2 (Daz)\r\nâ€¢ SLIC 2.1 BINS\r\nâ€¢ FAQ on creating firmware\r\nâ€¢ SLIC_ToolKit_V3.2\r\nâ€¢ KMSmicro WO w7 o2010-13 v1.0.1\r\nâ€¢ SuperMini_KMS\r\nâ€¢ KMSAuto Lite v1.2.6\r\nâ€¢ KMSAuto Net 2015 v1.4.4\r\nâ€¢ KMSpico 10.2.0 Final\r\nâ€¢ GUI MBR SLIC Loader 0.621 by DDDC v1.2 by Kolizey\r\nâ€¢ WindSLIC-UEFI-SLIC-injector\r\nâ€¢ Programs for Firmware\r\nâ€¢ FAQ activate Windows\r\nâ€¢ Reset (rearm)\r\nâ€¢ KMS Tools Portable 06.08.2016 (New)\r\nâ€¢ Re-Loader Activator 2.5 Final (New)\r\nâ€¢ Certificates (Certificates)\r\nâ€¢ PIDX Check by stupid user (Keys Verification)\r\nâ€¢ Three-OEM offline activation\r\n\r\nLanguage: Russian, English\r\nOS: Windows (XP), Windows (Vista), Windows (7), Windows (8), Windows (10).\r\n\r\nWhat's new\r\n-Updated KMS + Activators\r\n-Fixed minor bugs",
