The 24 fully-diagrammed and illustrated designs here offer something to furniture-makers of all abilities, from a simple dining-room table to the more complex breakfront bookcase. And these projects donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require a lavishly-equipped shop: each design requires little more than a bench, a small bandsaw, two or three portable power tools, and a basic kit of hand tools. Before diving into building plans, Ripley helps readers understand the basics of properly choosing materials and harmonizing the elements of furniture design.\n\n]\n\n",
