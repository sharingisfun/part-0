As always, this is all-in-one, you don't need to have any previous version of the game.\n\nThis update doesn't bring very much, it was mostly a new release for other platforms - Linux, Mac OS and SteamOS! Sadly, I can provide with Windows version only (for now).\n\nAnyway, as always, check the readme.txt for information, changelog.txt for full Changelog, and Additional Notes.txt for some other stuff.\n\nAlso, I'm improving my torrents too! I added some additional stuff this time.\n\nAnyway, as always, if you have any questions or anything, just leave them in comments.\n\nEnjoy, and ride your music!\n\nP.S. You can check out my Youtube channel for some Audiosurf 2 footage - nick is the same as here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7218287c18a328733f91a405b1842f8465cdd090","amp;dn":"Audiosurf+2+%28January+9th%2C+2015+Update%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7218287c18a328733f91a405b1842f8465cdd090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,24,40,124,24,163,40,115,63,145,164,5,177,132,47,132,101,205,208,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
