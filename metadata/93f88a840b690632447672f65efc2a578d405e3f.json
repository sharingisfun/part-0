It is also a practical, modern introduction to scientific computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive applications. This is a book about the parts of the Python language and libraries youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to effectively solve a broad set of data analysis problems. This book is not an exposition on analytical methods using Python as the implementation language.\n\n- Use the IPython interactive shell as your primary development environment\n- Learn basic and advanced NumPy (Numerical Python) features\n- Get started with data analysis tools in the pandas library\n- Use high-performance tools to load, clean, transform, merge, and reshape data\n- Create scatter plots and static or interactive visualizations with matplotlib\n- Apply the pandas groupby facility to slice, dice, and summarize datasets\n- Measure data by points in time, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s specific instances, fixed periods, or intervals\n- Learn how to solve problems in web analytics, social sciences, finance, and economics, through detailed examples\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1. Preliminaries\nChapter 2. Introductory Examples\nChapter 3. IPython: An Interactive Computing and Development Environment\nChapter 4. NumPy Basics: Arrays and Vectorized Computation\nChapter 5.
