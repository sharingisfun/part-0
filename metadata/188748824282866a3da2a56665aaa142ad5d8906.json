John, goes through the massive quantity of negatives, describes how impressed he was by the quality of the images, quickly determined they were not reverent to his project and just put them away. That could have very likely had been the end of the story, if the power of the images had not pushed him to fall in love with photography. John confides that his photo hobby quickly motivated him to set up a darkroom and devote large amounts of time shooting. As he learned more about photography, he recognized that those negatives he had bought, then stored, were the work of a real master. In an attempt to confirm his suspicion, he selected about 100 images and put them online with the hope that the feedback would confirm his judgement as to the strength of the images","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:188748824282866a3da2a56665aaa142ad5d8906","amp;dn":"Finding+Vivian+Maier+%282013%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"188748824282866a3da2a56665aaa142ad5d8906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,135,72,130,66,130,134,106,61,162,165,102,101,170,161,66,173,93,137,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
