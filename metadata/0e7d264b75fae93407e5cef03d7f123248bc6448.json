  "description": "Thievery Corporation\nIt Takes A Thief\nThe Very Best Of\nThievery Corporation (2010)\n\n\n\nThievery Corporation make abstract, instrumental, mid-tempo dance music whose classification falls somewhere between trip-hop and acid jazz. Featuring the production skills of Rob Garza and Eric Hilton, Thievery Corporation released several warmly received singles on their own Eighteenth Street Lounge (ESL) label (named after their own Washington, D.C. bar and nightclub) in 1996. Although previously known primarily among acid jazz and rare-groove DJs, the group shot to minor celebrity when a track from one of their early 12&quot;'s appeared on respected DJ/producers Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister's mix session for Studio K7's DJ Kicks series. Similar in many respects (and more than just number) to that Viennese production duo, Thievery Corporation subsequently grew in popularity among a wider audience of DJs and headphonaunts.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tElectronic\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Amerimacka\n02.Lebanese Blonde\n03.Facing East\n04.Holographic Universe\n05.Shadows Of Ourselves\n06.Sound The Alarm\n07.Until The Morning\n08.Sweet Tides\n09.Satyam Shivam Sundaram\n10.All That We Perceive\n11.Air Batucada\n12.Exilio (Rewound)\n13.Vampires\n14.Warning Shots\n15.The Richest Man In Babylon\n16.The Passings Stars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
