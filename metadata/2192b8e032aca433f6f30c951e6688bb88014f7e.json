It was the band's second album for Victory. The album features material written while the band had been touring, which Andrew Wade helped them demo. Recording took place between October and November 2008 at The Wade Studio, located in Ocala. Featured on the album are guest vocalists Mike Hranica (The Devil Wears Prada), Vincent Bennett (The Acacia Strain) and Sierra Kusterbeck (VersaEmerge). Recorded during the album sessions but remaining unreleased is an instrumental called &quot;Money Maker&quot;. Several of the album's songs appeared on the band's MySpace profile before the release of the album.\n\nPlanned for a mid-February 2009 release by Victory before being moved forward two weeks, the album sold 22,000 copies in the first week and charted at number 21 on the U.S. Billboard 200. It also charted at number 165 in the UK. It was the band's final album featuring Tom Denney on guitar, who was replaced on tour by Kevin Skaff. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;NJ Legion Iced Tea&quot; and &quot;The Downfall of Us All&quot; in early 2009, and &quot;I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?&quot; and &quot;Have Faith in Me&quot; in 2010.
