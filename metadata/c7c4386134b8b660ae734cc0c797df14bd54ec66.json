  "description": "Madonna - Studio Album Discography 1983-2015 [FLAC]\n\n\nThe definitive singles artist of the video age and a pop icon, one of the most commercially successful artists in music history.\n\n\nAfter stars reach a certain point, it's easy to forget what they became famous for and concentrate solely on their personas. Madonna is such a star. She rocketed to stardom so quickly in 1984 that it obscured most of her musical virtues. Appreciating her music became even more difficult as the decade wore on, as discussing her lifestyle became more common. However, one of Madonna's greatest achievements is how she has manipulated the media and the public with her music, her videos, her publicity, and her sexuality. Arguably, Madonna was the first female pop star to have complete control of her music and image.\n\n\n983 - Madonna [2001 Remaster]\n1984 - Like a Virgin [2001 Remaster]\n1986 - True Blue [2001 Remaster]\n1989 - Like a Prayer\n1992 - Erotica\n1994 - Bedtime Stories\n1998 - Ray of Light\n2000 - Music\n2003 - American Life\n2005 - Confessions on a Dance Floor\n2008 - Hard Candy\n2012 - MDNA [Japan Deluxe Edition]\n2015 - Rebel Heart [Deluxe Edition]\n\n\nExtras:\n\n1990 - The Immaculate Collection\n2001 - GHV2: Greatest Hits Volume 2\n2009 - Celebration [2-CD Deluxe Edition]\n\n\nAlbum artwork and rip logs are included.
