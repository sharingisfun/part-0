Co-produced by the group, Mark Neill, and Danger Mouse, it was released on May 18, 2010 on Nonesuch Records. Brothers was the band's commercial breakthrough, as it sold over 73,000 copies in the United States in its first week and peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, their best performance on the chart to that point. The album's lead single, &quot;Tighten Up&quot;, the only track from the album produced by Danger Mouse, became their most successful single to that point, spending 10 weeks at number one on the Alternative Songs chart and becoming the group's first single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 87. In April 2012, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA for shipping over one million copies. In 2011, it won three Grammy Awards, including honors for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Everlasting Light&quot;   \t3:24\n02. \t&quot;Next Girl&quot;   \t3:18\n03. \t&quot;Tighten Up&quot;   \t3:31\n04. \t&quot;Howlin' for You&quot;   \t3:12\n05. \t&quot;She's Long Gone&quot;   \t3:06\n06. \t&quot;Black Mud&quot;   \t2:10\n07. \t&quot;The Only One&quot;   \t5:00\n08. \t&quot;Too Afraid to Love You&quot;   \t3:25\n09. \t&quot;Ten Cent Pistol&quot;   \t4:29\n10. \t&quot;Sinister Kid&quot;   \t3:45\n11. \t&quot;The Go Getter&quot;   \t3:37\n12. \t&quot;I'm Not the One&quot;   \t3:49\n13. \t&quot;Unknown Brother&quot;   \t4:00\n14. \t&quot;Never Gonna Give You Up (Jerry Butler cover)&quot;   \t3:39\n15. \t&quot;These Days&quot;   \t5:12\n\nBonus Track\n\n16. \t&quot;Howlin' for You (feat.
