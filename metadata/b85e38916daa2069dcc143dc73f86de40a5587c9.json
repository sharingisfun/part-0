Periodic defragmentation often works wonders in bringing new life to a PC.\n\nNew: Lifetime Performance Statistics:\nYou can now see in detail the lifetime performance statistics of O&amp;O Defrag, from the moment you bought the program to the current moment.\nThese statistics show you just what O&amp;O Defrag is doing for your PC, and exactly what it has already achieved so far!\n\nNew: Deleting free space on hard disks for your privacy:\n\nPrivacy in capital letters: O&amp;O Defrag 18 can also be used for deleting free space on hard disks. This prevents traces of confidential data left over from partially-deleted or temporary files from falling into the hands of any strangers.\nSimply let O&amp;O Defrag 18 Pro confidential data securely automatically after a defragmentation run.\n\nPerformance increases of up to 100% are not uncommon:\nO&amp;O Defrag activates the hidden performance of your computer and packs file fragments efficiently and securely together. O&amp;O Defrag gives you everything from fully automated defragmentation to a professional set up: everything a good defragmentation software should give you.\nA continuous sorting of files on hard disks means they can be read quicker by Windows, which in turn accelerates all the read and write accesses by up to 100%.\n\nShorter defragmentation times and faster system and program starts:\nWith O&amp;O Defrag 18, several drives can be defragmented simultaneously. In addition, the algorithms have been substantially accelerated, reducing the time required for a defragmentation by up to 40%.\nBy using O&amp;O Defrag, files can be read and written much more quickly. What at first seems to be lost performance can easily be rediscovered and realized again with O&amp;O Defrag, giving you the peace of mind that your hardware is in good health and operating optimally.\n\nAutomatic defragmentation in the background:\nO&amp;O Defrag works quietly in the background so that the defragmentation process does not disturb other tasks and has no negative performance impact on your systems.\nThe O&amp;O ActivityMonitor periodically determines the system load. It controls the performance demand of O&amp;O Defrag during a defragmentation and adapts it to the current state. You can thereby work undisturbed while your system is being defragmented in the background.\n\nManufacturer-independent optimization for SSDs:\nO&amp;O Defrag makes it possible to optimize SSD drives through TRIM commands regardless of their manufacturer even under Windows XP and Vista. Access times for SSDs are sped up, and early wear and tear effects are prevented",
