  "description": "What is Universe Sandbox 2?\nUniverse Sandbox 2 is a physics based space simulator.\nCreate, destroy, and interact on a scale you've never before imagined.\nShoot asteroids at the Earth or cause a run away greenhouse effect. Rip apart the rings of Saturn or blow up the Sun.\n\nUltimate Power\n- Spawn massive stars, launch asteroids, and manipulate gravity with just a few clicks.\nFun &amp; Interactive\n- Explore our universe through unlimited experimentation.\nEasy to Use\n- Intuitive, game inspired controls make creation and destruction effortless.\nReal Physics\n- Use Newton's law of gravity to simulate the motions of the planets, moons, and stars.\n\n- Changelog -\nAlpha 12 (30.10.2014):\nNew Features\nThumbnail tile grids\n- In the Add panel, select icons at the top to filter the list of objects\n- In the Create panel, select icons to choose different tools\n- Click a tile to load a preset\n- Hover to see a description of the preset\n- Use custom settings: hover over the preset, click the edit icon, then press the Create button at the bottom of the window\nCreate Ã¢â€ â€™ Systems\n- Generate a random solar system by selecting a preset\n- Edit the settings to customize parameters such as the center body, number of planets, and planet distance\nCreate Ã¢â€ â€™ Encounters\n- Load a preset to create a simulation of a rogue planet approaching and passing through our solar system\n- Edit the settings to customize parameters such as start date, time step, and the rogueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s target\nCreate Ã¢â€ â€™ Grid\n- Load a preset Material Grid or Fragment Grid simulation for technical demonstrations\nPowers Ã¢â€ â€™ Exploder\n- Select the power and then click a body in the simulation to explode it (first pass on the feature, much work to be done)\nSimulations\n- Jupiter In Between Suns\n- Earth In Between Suns\n- 4 supernova sims\n- Supernova Closeup in Real Time, Supernova in Galaxy, Supernova in the Solar System, Stellar Evolution of our Sun\nPumpkins!\n- Add Ã¢â€ â€™ Human Sized Objects\nImprovements\nChoreography\n- A total of 201 2D and 25 3D choreographies\n- Added a Mass Randomizer setting\n- Default lighting set as Ã¢â‚¬Å“flashlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mode with shadows disabled\nCollision fragments\n- Now ejected from both bodies if they have a composition\n- Compositions consistent with bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s composition\n- Total fragment amount calculated by the most prevalent materials in the body, e.g. a rocky body will eject mostly silicate fragments\n- They now smoothly transition to bodies with composition-calculated sizes\n- Improved particle budgeting for better performance\nSupernovas\n- Lightcurve calculations for accurate expansion and temperature effects\n- Supernova clouds now fade towards the end of their lifetime\nPlanetoid rendering\n- Unified shading based on temperature, state, and composition\n- Now always spherical when in liquid state\n- Improved transitions for shape, color, opacity and normals of freezing and thawing planetoids\nSimulation\n- Added &quot;Semi Major Axis&quot; as a Chart mode preset\n- Random gas giants have a greater variety in color\n- Stars default to having age locked, rather than mass\n- All atmosphere variables now update when Climate is enabled\nUI\n- Added Info &amp; Stats section to Simulation panel (body count, total simulation mass,etc.)\n- Added YEAR-MONTH-DAY date to Solar System-based simulations and Encounters\n- Preview panel can be resized vertically by dragging its bottom edge\n- It will also maintain aspect ratio when property window is resized horizontally\n- Moved expanding submenus below Powers\n- Swapped Open and Create in Home panel\n- Added options for 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x sized screenshots in menu\n- Improved naming of saved screenshots\n- Moved window resolution presets to bottom of Settings panel (instead of in Main)\n- Removed &quot;chart&quot; quick button when hovering properties\n- Resizing the window on startup will now keep it that size\n- Logo is no longer blurry with low graphics settings\nFixes\n- Particles wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disappear if no other bodies are present\n- Planetoids now display correctly in preview window\n- Objects now have same scale in preview\n- Trails display properly for very low velocity objects\n- Body trails donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flicker for one frame\n- Capped max simultaneous sounds to 32 to respect audio subsystem limits\n- Solar system objects will not spawn away from the cursor\n- Mean Anomaly now reflects values greater than 180\nAlpha 11.3:\n- Just a small fix to a bug we introduced in Alpha 11.2 when initializing EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s climate that made our planet too cold. This also fixes an issue with the game window forcing itself on top of other windows.\n- The next major update will feature major improvements to collisions and fragments to make them even more spectacular.\nAlpha 11.2:\n- Improved the Auto Orbit command and fixed a couple small bugs.\nAlpha 11.1:\nImprovements\n- Overhauled stellar database with more accurate values\n- Added % to ppm UnitType\n- Steam startup option: -window or -windowed\n- Forces windowed mode on startup (overrides user setting)\n- Added consistent 'Preset' and 'Settings' labels for all Create, Rings, and Tethers panels\n- Added a horizontal line to separate Presets and Settings in create panels\nFixes\n- Disabled dynamic showing/hiding of Orbital Parent in Property window\n- Fixes flickering text bug\n- Enforced startup resolution in windowed mode (will then switch to user setting)\n- Fixes issue of users stuck in fullscreen mode and unable to start\nAlpha 11:\nNew Features\n- Shockwaves from collisions that travel along a bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface\n- Choreography\n- Home Ã¢â€ â€™ Create Ã¢â€ â€™ Choreography tab\n- Change parameters or use the presets to load interesting multiple-body orbital patterns\n- New Simulations\n- Ã¢â‚¬Å“2014 RCÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - asteroid which recently passed by Earth\n- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moons, 75 orbiting EarthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n- New tutorial text for sims under Ã¢â‚¬Å“AstronomyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nImprovements\n- Changed Steamworks integration - should fix issues for Linux users\n- Added back a number of integrators, so there are 8 in all now\n- Supernova graphical improvements\n- Improved handling of extreme Carbon Dioxide levels\n- Added &quot;Optimize for Climate View&quot;
