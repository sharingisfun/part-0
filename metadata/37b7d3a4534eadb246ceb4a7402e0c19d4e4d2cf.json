Youâ€²re not alone. Fortunately, this downâ€“toâ€“earth guide helps you approach it from a new angle, making it easier than ever to conquer your fears and score your highest in geometry. From getting started with geometry basics to making friends with lines and angles, youâ€²ll be proving triangles congruent, calculating circumference, using formulas, and serving up pi in no time.\r\n\r\nGeometry is a subject full of mathematical richness and beauty. But itâ€²s a subject that bewilders many students because itâ€²s so unlike the math theyâ€²ve done before it requires the use of deductive logic in formal proofs. If youâ€²re having a hard time wrapping your mind around what that even means, youâ€²ve come to the right place! Inside, youâ€²ll find out how a proofâ€²s chain of logic works and even discover some secrets for getting past rough spots along the way. You donâ€²t have to be a math genius to grasp geometry, and this book helps you get unâ€“stumped in a hurry!\r\n\r\n* Find out how to decode complex geometry proofs\r\n\r\n* Learn to reason deductively and inductively\r\n\r\n* Make sense of angles, arcs, area, and more\r\n\r\n* Improve your chances of scoring higher in your geometry class\r\n\r\nThereâ€²s no reason to let your nerves get jangled over geometry your understanding will take new shape with the help of Geometry For Dummies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b7d3a4534eadb246ceb4a7402e0c19d4e4d2cf","amp;dn":"Geometry+For+Dummies+-+3rd+Revised+Edition+%282016%29+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b7d3a4534eadb246ceb4a7402e0c19d4e4d2cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,183,211,164,83,78,173,178,70,206,180,167,64,46,12,25,212,228,210,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
