  "description": "Wu-Tang Clan\nPlaylist: The Very Best Of Wu-Tang Clan (2009) *EXPLICIT*\n\n\nEmerging in 1993, when Dr. Dre's G-funk had overtaken the hip-hop world, the Staten Island, NY-based Wu-Tang Clan proved to be the most revolutionary rap group of the mid-'90s -- and only partially because of their music. Turning the standard concept of a hip-hop crew inside out, the Wu-Tang Clan were assembled as a loose congregation of nine MCs, almost as a support group. Instead of releasing one album after another, the Clan were designed to overtake the record industry in as profitable a fashion as possible -- the idea was to establish the Wu-Tang as a force with their debut album and then spin off into as many side projects as possible. In the process, the members would all become individual stars as well as receive individual royalty checks.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRap &amp; Hip-Hop\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n01.Shame On A Nigga\n02.The Projects\n03.As High As Wu-Tang Get\n04.C.R.E.A.M.\n05.Cash Still RulesScary Hours (Still Don't Nothing Move But The Money)\n06.Uzi (Pinky Ring) (Dirty)\n07.Triumph (Feat.
