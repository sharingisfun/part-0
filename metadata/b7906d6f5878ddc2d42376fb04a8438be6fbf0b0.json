Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7906d6f5878ddc2d42376fb04a8438be6fbf0b0","amp;dn":"Chef+%282014%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7906d6f5878ddc2d42376fb04a8438be6fbf0b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,144,109,111,88,120,221,194,212,35,118,251,4,168,67,139,230,251,240,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
