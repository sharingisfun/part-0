It was founded in Chicago in 1953 by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner's mother.[3] Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude[4] models (Playmates), Playboy played an important role in the sexual revolution[5] and remains one of the world's best-known brands, having grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc., with a presence in nearly every medium.[6] In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe magazine has a long history of publishing short stories by notable novelists such as Arthur C. Clarke,[7] Ian Fleming,[7] Vladimir Nabokov,[8] Saul Bellow, Chuck Palahniuk, P. G. Wodehouse,[7] Haruki Murakami, and Margaret Atwood.[7] With a regular display of full-page color cartoons, it became a showcase for notable cartoonists, including Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Cole,[9] Eldon Dedini,[10] Jules Feiffer,[11] Shel Silverstein,[12] Erich Sokol,[7] Roy Raymonde,[13] Gahan Wilson, and Rowland B. Wilson.[14] Playboy features monthly interviews of notable public figures, such as artists, architects, economists, composers, conductors, film directors, journalists, novelists, playwrights, religious figures, politicians, athletes and race car drivers. The magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, although it often interviews conservative celebrities.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8bbcd9f584d247115d7b897e9002e65c6ea51e9","amp;dn":"Playboy+Magazine+-+January+to+August+%282016%29+-+pdf+-+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8bbcd9f584d247115d7b897e9002e65c6ea51e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,187,205,159,88,77,36,113,21,215,184,151,233,0,46,101,198,234,81,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
