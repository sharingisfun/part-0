  "description": "Mirror's Edge  (c) Electronic Arts\n\nrelease date ...: February 2767\nprotection .....: Steam\n# of discs .....: 1\nlanguages ......: EN/FR/DE/IT/ES/PT/PL/RU/CZ/HU/KR/\nCN-S/CN-T\n\nIn a city where information is  heavily  monitored,\nagile couriers called Runners  transport  sensitive\ndata away  from  prying  eyes.  In  this  seemingly\nutopian paradise, a crime has been committed,  your\nsister has  been  framed  and  now  you  are  being\nhunted. You are a  Runner  called  Faith  and  this\ninnovative first-person  action-adventure  is  your\nstory. Mirror's Edge delivers you straight into the\nshoes of this unique heroine as she  traverses  the\nvertigo-inducing  cityscape,  engaging  in  intense\ncombat and fast paced chases. With a  never  before\nseen sense of movement and perspective, you will be\ndrawn into Faith's world. A world that is visceral,\nimmediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or\nplummet? One thing is certain,  in  this  city  you\nwill learn how to  run.  From  the  makers  of  the\ngroundbreaking Battlefield franchise, Mirror's Edge\nis an action-adventure experience unlike any other.\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install the game\n3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir to\nBinaries folder\n4- Go To Hell!\n\nNOTE:\nI'ts a good idea to turn on Subtitles in the options\nmenu for languages without spoken dialogs translated.\n",
