Fabian (Sid Lucero) is a highly intelligent law student whose fiery rants against Philippine injustice captivate his admiring classmates. Joaquin (Archie Alemania) is a humble husband and father whose dream of transcending poverty is dashed after a tragic injury renders him unemployable. Unable to keep up his payments to vicious loan shark Miss Magda (Mae Paner), Joaquin falls into a deep depression that only worsens when Miss Magda turns up dead, and he's convicted of killing her. Meanwhile, Fabian, the real murderer, wanders free despite being a prisoner of his own outrage against his duplicitous, apathetic government. Incredibly, Joaquin finds a strange sense of peace in prison life, experiencing a strange transformation as his wife Eliza (Angeli Bayani) falls into a deep despair.\n\nRip Specs (BR Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Norte, the End of History.2013.BRRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 332 Kbps\nLength            : 4.08 GiB for 4h 10mn 11s 872ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 010 Kbps\nAspect            : 1024 x 428 (2.393) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 320 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : tl\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2852432/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2852432/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Filipino, English\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip from Blu-Ray","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba6d2d46d569ca4219568f426532dc1e9715e31","amp;dn":"Norte%2C+the+End+of+History.2013.BRRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba6d2d46d569ca4219568f426532dc1e9715e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,166,210,212,109,86,156,164,33,149,104,244,38,83,45,193,233,113,94,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
