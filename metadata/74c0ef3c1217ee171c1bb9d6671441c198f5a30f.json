Whether it's with love and dating, career and ambition, friends, or gossip, Naya inspires us to follow our own destiny and step overâ€“or plod throughâ€“all the crap along the way. After her rise and fall from early childhood stardom, barely eking her way through high school, a brief stint as a Hooters waitress, going through thick and thin with her mom/manager, and resurrecting her acting career as Santana Lopez on Glee, Naya emerged from these experiences with some key life lessons:\r\n\r\nSorry:\r\n- All those times I scrawled &quot;I HATE MY MOM&quot; in my journal. So many moms and teenage daughters don't get alongâ€“we just have to realize it's nothing personal on either side.\r\n- At-home highlights and DIY hair extensions. Some things are best left to the experts, and hair dye is one of them.\r\n- Falling in love with the idea of a person, instead of the actual person.\r\n\r\nNot Sorry:\r\n- That I don't always get along with everyone. Having people not like you is a risk you have to take to be real, and I'll take that over being fake any day.\r\n- Laughing at the gossip instead of getting upset by it.\r\n- Getting my financial disasters out of the way earlyâ€“before I was married or had a familyâ€“so that the only credit score that I wrecked was my own.\r\n\r\nEven with a successful career and a family that she loves more than anything else, Naya says, &quot;There's still a thirteen-year-old girl inside of me making detailed lists of how I can improve, who's never sure of my own self-worth.&quot; Sorry Not Sorry is for that thirteen-year-old in all of us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c0ef3c1217ee171c1bb9d6671441c198f5a30f","amp;dn":"Sorry+Not+Sorry%3A+Dreams%2C+Mistakes...+%282016%29+by+Naya+Rivera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c0ef3c1217ee171c1bb9d6671441c198f5a30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,192,239,60,18,23,238,23,28,27,185,214,103,20,65,193,152,245,163,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
