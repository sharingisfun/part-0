Play\nPLEASE REMEMBER TO SEED, MANY OTHERS WANT THIS GAME! :)\nIf you like this game, support the developers and BUY IT!\n\nTitle: GUILD OF DUNGEONEERING\nGenre: Role-playing - Turn-based - Fantasy\nWorks on: Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10)\nLanguages: Text only: English\nModes: Single-player\nReleased: July 14, 2015\nSize: 181 MB\nCompany: Gambrinous / Versus Evil\nStore page: https://www.gog.com/game/guild_of_dungeoneering\n\nAbout:\nThe Deluxe Edition includes the Guild of Dungeoneering Original Soundtrack. This little gem is full of all the theme music with lyrics, all the background music in the game, the bonus song with lyrics from the official launch trailer and of course all of the Bard's in game tunes that have taunted you, made you laugh or sung your praises.\nThis is a total of 23 tracks (MP3) for a total playtime of 1 hour 47 minutes. (Not including the Bard's songs)\nBecome the ultimate Dungeon Master as you bribe, entice and coax your heroes through their adventures on a quest to restore your guild to its ultimate glory!\nGuild of Dungeoneering is a turn-based dungeon crawler with a twist: instead of controlling the hero you build the dungeon around him. Using cards drawn from your Guild decks, you lay down rooms, monsters, traps and of course loot! Meanwhile your hero is making his own decisions on where to go and what to fight. But will he be strong enough to take on the dungeon's overlord? In between dungeon runs you manage your Guild, building new rooms to attract new classes of adventurer and to expand your decks of cards with more powerful items and events.\nRestore your guild to its former glory as Dungeon Master by taking control of your fledgling group of heroes and leading them to victory! (after admitting to a few defeats of course).\nEntice, coax and bribe your heroes to clear the dungeons you build by strategically placing rooms, monsters and loot from the cards you are dealt.\nGet to know each of your heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personality and traits, upgrade your existing heroes, and add new heroes while you try out new strategies to keep from sending them to their doom!\nManage your guild well and spend your hard earned Ã¢â‚¬ËœgloryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wisely to level up and unlock more rooms and equipment. Improving your guild means youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a better chance at beating the harder dungeons as you progress and take down the ultimate dungeon overlord.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, Memory: 2 GB RAM, Hard Drive: 3 GB available space.\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 / 8 / 10, Memory: 4 GB RAM, Hard Drive: 6 GB available space",
