  "description": "ESET Smart Security offers advanced detection technologies and multi-layered security features. Designed for a low footprint, fast scanning, it packs security features and customization options for consistent and personalized security on- or offline. ESET Smart Security is built on ESET's unique heuristic technology that identifies viruses that have never been seen before. This enables them to protect your computer proactively, in real-time, against new viruses and cyber threats that conventional signature-based antivirus products don't catch. ESET Smart Security has all the same features as ESET NOD32 Antivirus with the addition of parental controls, antispam module, and an intelligent firewall.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n::Installation Instructions::\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nREMOVE ANY ANTI-VIRUS/FIREWALL SOFTWARE BEFORE INSTALLING\n\n- If UAC is enabled, right click the fix and run it with administrative privileges,\notherwise, just run it normally.\n- Begin the ESET installation and just follow through.\n- Allow the fix to run, do not cancel it, and ensure you stay connected to your network.\n- ESET should restart then continue updating. Once it's done, the installation is finished. ",
