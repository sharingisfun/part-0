  "description": "This isn't an inconvenient truth really. It is a convenient threat to the world, created for and by those people that want, but not really deserve power. \n\nBecause if people perceives a threat to the world, they will vote for a &quot;saviour&quot;.\n\nDon't be mislead. The greenhouse effect won't kill you. Poverty kills people, and one way to help poor people in the world is to let them burn &quot;dirty&quot; oil and coal. Another way is by letting the world economy grow, by not imposing excessive taxes on energy.\n\nGlobal warming is an irritant, but it is a price we must pay so that people in China, India and Africa can enjoy the same living standard as people in the West, because they deserve it.\n\nThis film is taken from a preview DVD, so the quality is good.",
