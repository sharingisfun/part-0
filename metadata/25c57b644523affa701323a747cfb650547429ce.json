  "description": "Band of Brothers is a 2001 ten-part television World War II mini-series based on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose. It's title came from the famous 'Crispin Crispian' speech which Henry V gave in Shakespeare's play just before the battle of Agincourt in which he stated '. . .we few, we happy few, we band of brothers . . .'\r\n\r\nIt was executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks after their successful collaboration on the Academy Award-winning World War II film Saving Private Ryan (1998). The episodes first aired in 2001 on HBO and is still run frequently on various TV networks around the world.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of &quot;E&quot; Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division from their initial training starting in 1942 to the end of World War II. \r\n\r\nThey parachuted behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day in support of the landings at Utah beach, participated in the liberation of Carentan and again parachuted into action during Operation Market Garden. They also liberated a concentration camp and were the first to enter Hitler's mountain retreat in Berchtesgarten. \r\n\r\nA fascinating tale of comradeship that is, in the end, a tale of ordinary men who did extraordinary things.\r\n\r\nCast includes:  Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Matthew Settle, Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Hardy",
