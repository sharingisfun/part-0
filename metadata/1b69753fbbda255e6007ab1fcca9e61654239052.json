Garrity, Lori Pedersen\n2001\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521797071\nISBN-13: 978-0521797078\nPDF\n376 pages \n9.50 MB\n\nFew beginning graduate students in mathematics and other quantitative subjects possess the daunting breadth of mathematical knowledge expected of them when they begin their studies. This book will offer students a broad outline of essential mathematics and will help to fill in the gaps in their knowledge. The author explains the basic points and a few key results of all the most important undergraduate topics in mathematics, emphasizing the intuitions behind the subject. The topics include linear algebra, vector calculus, differential and analytical geometry, real analysis, point-set topology, probability, complex analysis, set theory, algorithms, and more. An annotated bibliography offers a guide to further reading and to more rigorous foundations.\n\n======================\n\nHow to Study as a Mathematics Major\n\nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA\n2013\nLara Alcock\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0199661316\nISBN-13: 978-0199661312\nPDF \n288 pages \n11.1 MB\n\nEvery year, thousands of students declare mathematics as their major. Many are extremely intelligent and hardworking. However, even the best will encounter challenges, because upper-level mathematics involves not only independent study and learning from lectures, but also a fundamental shift from calculation to proof.\n\nThis shift is demanding but it need not be mysterious -- research has revealed many insights into the mathematical thinking required, and this book translates these into practical advice for a student audience. It covers every aspect of studying as a mathematics major, from tackling abstract intellectual challenges to interacting with professors and making good use of study time. Part 1 discusses the nature of upper-level mathematics, and explains how students can adapt and extend their existing skills in order to develop good understanding. Part 2 covers study skills as these relate to mathematics, and suggests practical approaches to learning effectively while enjoying undergraduate life.\n\nAs the first mathematics-specific study guide, this friendly, practical text is essential reading for any mathematics major.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b69753fbbda255e6007ab1fcca9e61654239052","amp;dn":"All+the+Mathematics+You+Missed%3A+How+to+Study+as+a+Mathematics+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b69753fbbda255e6007ab1fcca9e61654239052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,105,117,63,187,218,37,94,96,7,171,31,204,169,230,22,84,35,144,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
