The book combines an accessible and straightforward style, with a strong foundation of knowledge. The text treats reasoning as an aspect of communication, not an abstract exercise in logic. The book not only provides detailed advice on how to practise analytical skills, but also demonstrates how these skills can be used in research and writing. In particular, it emphasises how to develop arguments that are coherent and that take account of their audience and context. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a93f5e82bc82a0657552d5015b6d2c297f883d","amp;dn":"Smart+Thinking%3A+Skills+for+Critical+Understanding+and+Writing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a93f5e82bc82a0657552d5015b6d2c297f883d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,169,63,94,130,188,130,160,101,117,82,213,1,91,109,44,41,127,136,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
