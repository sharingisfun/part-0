In any case, there is a vindictive, accusatory tone to songs such as &quot;What Do You Want From Me&quot; and &quot;Poles Apart,&quot; and the overarching theme, from the album title to the graphics to the &quot;I-you&quot; pronouns in most of the lyrics, has to do with dichotomies and distinctions, with &quot;I&quot; always having the upper hand. Musically, Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Wright have largely turned the clock back to the pre-Dark Side of the Moon Floyd, with slow tempos, sustained keyboard chords, and guitar solos with a lot of echo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d030203445e01a757eca53f7c4b75723df879c4d","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Division+Bell+%282014%29+%5BHD+Tracks%5D+24.96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d030203445e01a757eca53f7c4b75723df879c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,48,32,52,69,224,26,117,126,202,83,247,196,183,87,35,223,135,156,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
