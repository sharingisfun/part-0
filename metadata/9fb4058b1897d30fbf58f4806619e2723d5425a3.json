  "description": "\nPublisher: Baker Books (March 1, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0801018862\r\nISBN-13: 978-0801018862\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to money management, most of us take a hands-off approach because we're just not confident that we have the know-how needed. But personal finance is actually more personal than it is finance. Tim Maurer has made a career out of distilling complex financial concepts into understandable, doable actions. In this eminently practical book, he shows readers how to\r\n\r\n- better understand their values and goals in order to simplify their money decisions\r\n- budget major expenses intelligently\r\n- reduce and eliminate debt\r\n- make vital decisions on home, auto, and life insurance\r\n- establish a world-class investment portfolio\r\n- craft a workable retirement plan\r\n- and more\r\n\r\nReaders will be relieved to see that managing their money is actually not as complicated as they thought--and that they can take control of their financial future starting today.v",
