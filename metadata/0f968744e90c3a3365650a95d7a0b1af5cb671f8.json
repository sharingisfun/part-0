  "description": "=========================================================================================================\nAdobe Reader XI 11.0.10\n=========================================================================================================\n=========================================================================================================\n\n\nAdobe Reader is the most popular program in the world for viewing, creating, managing and manipulating PDF (Portable Document Format) files. It is the standard that all other PDF readers are judged against. Publically released in 1993, Adobe Reader was originally priced at $50 per user before Adobe separated its product range to offer Adobe Reader freeware and their professional Adobe Acrobat versions. PDF became the file format of choice for businesses thanks to its cross platform flexibility and security capabilities.\n\nSimple UI\n\nAdobe ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s UI is simple and intuitive. Classic tools (text selection, zoom, snapshots, find, etc.) can be accessed from the top navigation menu and buttons. The latest version also includes advanced Tools (create, export, send and store options), Sign and Comment features. You can share iterations, comments and signatures by email or using the Adobe SendNow service.\n\nSecurity\n\nAdobe Reader XI is the safest version Adobe have released. This is mainly due the new Protected Mode which loads potentially hazardous items and code in a sandboxed area, isolated from the rest of your system.\n\nSpeed\n\nThere have been some criticisms over Adobe ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speed compared to other lightweight PDF readers. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true; Adobe Reader does have more plugins and extensions than most PDF readers which can slow operation. That being said the difference for the average user is negligible and those add-ons can be disabled if they are not required. In terms of general operation, Adobe Reader renders documents with high detail and true colour reproduction quickly. Later editions have also had work done to improve Adobe ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact on memory usage so you should find multitasking takes less strain on your system.\n\n==========================================================================================================\n==========================================================================================================\nDescription\n--------------\nTitle : Adobe Reader 11.0.10\nFilename : AdbeRdr11010_en_US.exe\nFile size : 72.34MB (75,858,112 bytes)\nRequirements : Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / Windows7 / XP64 / Vista64 / Windows7 64 / Windows8 / Windows8 64\nLanguages : Multiple languages\nLicense : Freeware\nAuthor : Adobe Systems Inc\nHomepage : www.adobe.com/products/reader/\nMD5 Checksum : 31688EFBC3B9C99914A5BB7FB58AEC9E\n\n\n==========================================================================================================",
