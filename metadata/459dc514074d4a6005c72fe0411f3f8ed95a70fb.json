  "description": "Adobe Photoshop Elements is a powerful yet simple graphic editing tool with two main apps: the element Organizer and the image Editor. Both tools are perfectly embedded within each other and easily accessible via the menu on the top of the program's sleek, elegant dark interface.\n\nThe Organizer in Adobe Photoshop Elements lets you not only browse photos, but also rate them, add a caption, use them as wallpaper and also add name tags to them in order to identify the people that appear on the images.\n\nThe Editor in Adobe Photoshop Elements includes all the tools you need to edit, fix, share and design all sorts of printed creations with your images. The program features three different editing modes (Full, Quick and Guided), suitable for all levels of expertise. You'll be able to resize, crop, remove the red-eye effect, adjust color and lighting, tweak levels and contrasts, or simply apply some automatic quick fixes to your photos. Adobe Photoshop Elements also helps you apply more elaborate effects in an easy, step-by-step process.\n\nAdobe Photoshop Elements is also a perfect tool to create photo collages, postcards, calendars and other similar goodies with your images. The Sharing tool, in turn, allows you to create online albums, burn your images onto CD or DVD, send them by email, and share them on Facebook or Flickr straight away.\n\nAdobe Photoshop Elements is a great application for quick image editing, photo sharing and easy-to-create photo artwork. On the downside, some tools can be a bit confusing at first. Also, Adobe Photoshop Elements doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really work as a stripped-down version of Photoshop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a totally different program that combines the power of Adobe tools with a great simplicity of use.\n\nMost recently Adobe Photoshop Elements has been updated with some useful tweaking functions such as Pet Red Eye removal, the ability to move objects around in an image, and improved integration with mobile devices such as tablets.\n\nAdobe Photoshop Elements is a powerful application with which you can organize, edit, enhance and share your images in many ways, without requiring professional photo editing skills.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Disconnect net.\n- Install Trial \n- Run Trial and close.\n- Copy Patch to the Photoshop Elements 13 dir\n- Run Patch, select your version amtlib.dll and apply.\n- Block soft in Firewall.\n- Run Program\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/23503708118280834537.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/23503708118280834537.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/28062722772314158057.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/28062722772314158057.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/28310289944618548944.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/28310289944618548944.jpg&lt;/a&gt;",
